abstract = {Deep learning based human activity recognition approach combines spatial and temporal information to complete the recognition task. The temporal information is extracted by optical flow, which is always compensated by the warping method in order to achieve better performance. However, these methods usually take the global feature as the starting point, only consider global information of video frames, and ignore local information that reflects the changes of human behavior, causing the algorithm to be sensitive to the external environment such as occlusion, illumination change. In view of the above problems, this paper fuses the local spatial features of video frames, global spatial features and temporal features to recognize different actions, and further extracts the visual attention weight to make constraint on the global spatial features. Experiments show that the algorithm proposed in this paper has better accuracy compared with the existing methods.}

In this paper, we introduce a novel probabilistic framework that combines multiple traits whilst incorporating their uncertainty to tackle the emerging challenge: locating a person from a semantic query. In addressing this, we improve clothing texture recognition by leveraging Dempster-Shafer theory against an ensemble of support vector machines; achieving state-of-the-art performance for high and low resolution clothing textures. Our proposed person search framework combines information from clothing texture and colour in the torso and leg regions to produce a probabilistic match between unknown subjects and the designated target query. Results are presented on a newly created 520 subject surveillance dataset which is made available to researchers. This multi-modal person search technique achieves promising results for locating target subjects, without the requirement of pre-search target enrollment.}

In the field of geological information technology, not only traditional digital products such as text, image, audio and video are produced, but also 3D model digital products unique to geological information technology, which are geological bodies, geological phenomena, geological structures, geological processes and geology. Regular 3D visualization analysis and the foundation and platform for comprehensive decision making of 3D visualization, the 3D model of geological body plays an increasingly important role in the field of geological information technology. Of course, it also faces the problems faced by traditional digital products and copyright protection. In this paper, the advantages and disadvantages of digital watermarking technology in copyright protection and the characteristics of geological body 3D model itself, and the current mature 3D model digital watermarking algorithm are introduced. The research idea of 3D geological body digital watermarking algorithm based on point cloud model is proposed. According to the spatial characteristics of the point cloud model of geological body, the spatial characteristic variables of the point cloud model are obtained by using the spatial characteristic analysis algorithm. The spatial domain information represented by the spatial characteristic variables is transformed into the frequency domain information, and then the frequency domain information is analyzed by means of mathematical statistics to extract the digital watermarking information of the whole geological body point cloud model. The feasibility of the algorithm is analyzed and verified by the experimental analysis. The digital watermark information before and after the attack is extracted by geometric attacks such as affine transformation and shearing. The extracted digital watermark information is correlated with the coefficient analysis and the robustness of the algorithm is obtained. A better robustness effect can effectively protect the copyright of the owner of the 3D model of the geological body.}

abstract = {The conventional methods of urban impervious surfaces extraction mainly use the shallow-layer machine learning algorithms based on the medium- or low-resolution remote sensing images, and always provide low accuracy and poor automation level because the potential of multi-source remote sensing data are not fully utilized and the low-level features are not effectively organized. In order to address this problem, a novel method (AEIDLMRS) is proposed to automatically extract impervious surfaces based on deep learning and multi-source remote sensing data. First, the multi-source remote sensing data consisting of LIDAR points cloud data, Landsat8 images and Pl√©iades-1A images are pre-processed, re-sampled and registered, and then the combined features of spectral, elevation and intensity from the multi-source data are denoised using the minimum noise fraction (MNF) method to generate some representative MNF features. A small number of reliable labelled samples are automatically extracted using the fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering method based on the MNF features. Secondly, the convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract the representative features of the neighborhood windows of each pixel in the fused Pl√©iades-1A image through multi-layer convolution and pooling operations. Finally, the combined features of MNF features and CNN features are pre-learned via the deep belief network (DBN). The DBN parameters are globally optimized jointly using the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) classifier on the top level and the small set of labelled samples extracted via FCM, and the urban impervious surfaces are distinguished from others based on the trained ELM classifier and morphological operations. Experiments are performed to compare the proposed method with other three related methods in three different experimental regions respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that AEIDLMRS has better accuracy and automation level than the others under relatively good efficiency, and it is more suitable for the extraction of complex urban impervious surfaces.}

Not only that, the learned features by DLPP are linear combinations of all the original features. So, it is hard to know which features play an important role in feature extraction, and the learned features often contain irrelevant information. In this paper, we propose a robust version of DLPP based on L2,p-norm with 0<p<1, termed DLPP-L2,p, for image feature extraction and recognition. DLPP-L2,p learns an optimal projection matrix by maximizing the L2,p-norm-based locality preserving between-class dispersion and minimizing the L2,p-norm-based locality preserving within-class dispersion simultaneously. Furthermore, by imposing an L2,p-norm penalty on the projection matrix to achieve row-sparsity, DLPP-L2,p can discard irrelevant features and transform relevant features simultaneously. Experimental results on several image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of DLPP-L2,p.}

In this paper, we propose a method, zero shot learning by partial transfer from source domain with L2,1 norm constraint, called ZSLPT which embeds visual similarity and semantic similarity to transfer partial source samples. The relevant source samples are selected, while the irrelevant are eliminated.

Then, it uses fuzzy C means algorithm (FCM) to construct historical databases containing 5000 samples. Finally, it takes the meteorological factors corresponding to visibility as the sample of historical databases, and uses a hierarchical sparse representation to predict the visibility of new inputs. Experiment, conducted with the data of European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), indicates a better performance of the hierarchical sparse representation in contrast to a sparse representation. And the visibility forecast based on hierarchical sparse representation is better than Beijing Regional Environmental Meteorology Prediction System (BREMPS) and BP neural network. The hierarchical sparse representation is simple and easy to expand, which improves the accuracy and reduce the absolute error, which is convenience for other meteorological analysis.}

Such work becomes extremely time consuming and unbearably tedious when each query returns tens of thousands results with an uncertain recall rate. To overcome this problem, we develop a topic-specific image indexing and presentation method for discovering interactions or relatedness of medical terms from MEDLINE, based on which a prototype tool is implemented to help discover interactions between terms of types of diseases. The merits of the method is illustrated by search examples using the tool and MEDLINE abstract dataset.}

abstract = {Though blind image quality assessment (BIQA) is highly desired in perceptual-oriented image processing systems, it is extremely difficult to design a reliable BIQA method. With the help of the prior knowledge, the human visual system (HVS) hierarchically perceives the quality degradation during the visual recognition. Inspired by this, we suggest different levels of distortion generate individual degradations on hierarchical features, and propose to consider the degradations on both low and high level features for quality prediction. By mimicking the orientation selectivity (OS) mechanism in the primary visual cortex, an OS based local structure is designed for low-level visual information representation. At the meantime, the deep residual network, which possesses multiple levels for feature integration, is employed to extract the deep semantics for high-level visual content representation. By fusing the local structure and the deep semantics, a hierarchical feature set is acquired. Next, the correlations between the degradations of image qualities and their corresponding hierarchical feature sets are analyzed, and a novel hierarchical feature degradation (HFD) based BIQA (HFD-BIQA) method is built. Experimental results on the legacy and wild image quality assessment databases demonstrate the prediction accuracy of the proposed HFD-BIQA method, and verify that the HFD-BIQA performs highly consistent with the subjective perception.}

The VIO can provide absolute pitch and roll angles estimating value, but no the absolute azimuth. In the paper, we proposed a VIO aided by compass, which can obtain the azimuth with respect to the north direction in the geographic frame. Moreover, aided by compass, the yaw angle estimating error was reduced to a greater degree, due to the measurement of azimuth. Furthermore, the consistency of the VIO backend estimator is improved as well, while the accuracy of the estimated pose states was also wholly improved. The aiding approach is a tightly-couple information fusion system of camera, IMU and magnetoresistive sensors. The optimization method is based on the pre-integration and bundle adjustment. In the paper, we derived the compass residual model based on the pre-integration model, and then its Jacobian and covariance formation were deduced to solve the nonlinear equations. The compass aided VIO software was implemented based on the Nvidia Jetson Tx2. The system was fully tested based on hardware-in-the-loop simulation and vehicle test in the real physical environment. The pose errors of VIOs with and without compass aiding were compared in the above tests. The simulation results showed that the position was and yaw errors were improved obviously; the compass aided VIO was still consistent, but the pure VIO was consistent not. The consistency character is evaluated by average NEES by Monte-Carlo in simulation. The vehicle test showed that the position error was reduced by 23%; the yaw error was reduced by 21%. As a result, the compass aided VIO not only improved the pose estimated accuracy, especially position and yaw, but also improved the consistency of VIO system.}

In this paper, by analyzing the spectral energy changes during the input process of motion artifacts, a cosine transform LMS adaptive cancellation algorithm (DCT-LMS) implementation is proposed aiming to remove the motion artifacts from the ECG. In order to study the performance of the algorithm and effectively remove the motion artifacts in the ECG signal, this thesis collects ECG signals of people's daily activities from fabric-based chest straps with dry electrodes. It verifies the classic LMS adaptive elimination algorithm and the normalized one. Besides, two LMS adaptive cancellation algorithms based on sine and cosine transform are compared. The simulation and experimental results show that the cosine-based adaptive algorithm is superior to the classical LMS algorithm in eliminating high-amplitude motion artifact noise of ECG.}

This study was conducted in the Dapingliang skarn copper deposit and its surrounding area, the Shanshan County of the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, China. In order to successfully detect alteration zones associated with skarns, this study identified skarns rather than alteration minerals using field spectra of skarn outcrops. In this study, skarn in pixels was identified from spectral overall shape and spectral shapes of absorption-bands; SAM (spectral angle mapper) was applied in the identification. When SAM scores of spectral overall shape were less than 0.022‚ÄØrad, the identified skarns were mainly distributed in the contact zones of intrusive rocks and carbonates; in particular, the three identified skarns areas (R1, R2 and R3) were consistent with the skarn areas in the geological map of the study area. The field inspection of skarns showed that the identified objects of the three marked targets (A, B and C) were almost consistent with the ground objects. These obtained results demonstrated that using the field spectra, it was possible to identify skarns in the hyperspectral image. To evaluate the identified skarn zones for use in mineral exploration, the end-member spectra extracted from the image were analysed, and alteration zones were detected using these end-member spectra. Compared with these alteration zones, the identified skarn zones were more reliable for mineral exploration of the study area.}

Moreover the approximation and detail coefficients are modified according to the entropy of each subband. The pixel‚Äôs distribution of the coarse reconstructed LDR image is then adjusted according to a perceptual quantizer with respect to the human visual system using a piecewise linear function. Simulation results provide good results, both in terms of visual quality and TMQI metric, compared to existing competitive TM approaches.}

In such a video both the background and foreground change in each frame of the image sequence; making the separation of actual moving object from the background a challenging task. In this work, moving objects are detected as clusters of spatio-temporal blobs generated by spatio-temporal analysis of the image sequence using a three-dimensional Gabor filter and merged using Minimum Spanning Tree. Problem of data association during tracking is solved by Linear Assignment Problem and occlusion is handled by the application of Kalman filter. The major advantage of the proposed method is that, it does not require initialization or training on sample data to perform. Our algorithm demonstrated very satisfactory state-of-the-art result on benchmark videos. The performance of the algorithm is equivalent or superior to some benchmark algorithms.}

abstract = {Due to the complexity of urban surface, the differences in impervious surface materials, the mutual interference between the spectra of ground objects and the huge impact of ground object shadows in high-resolution remote sensing (HRRS) images, it is improper to directly use shallow machine learning algorithms and conventional object-oriented segmentation methods to extract urban impervious surfaces from HRRS images. Therefore, a method for automatic extraction of impervious surfaces from HRRS images based on deep learning (AEISHIDL) is proposed to address this problem. Firstly, the original HRRS images are pre-processed and the Gram-Schmidt algorithm is employed for the fusion of panchromatic and multi-spectral bands in HRRS images. In addition, an enhanced bilateral filtering method considering edge characteristics (EBFCEC) is designed and adopted to remove noises and enhance edges of man-made objects in original HRRS images. Secondly, the EBFCEC filtered images are partitioned into multi-layer object sets by using improved marker watershed based on LAB color space (IMWLCS), and the related objects in different sets are re-segmented to have the same edges through edge integration, after which we extract spectral feature averages and shape feature values of all objects while the convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to calculate the CNN feature averages of all pixel neighborhoods in each object. Finally, the fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM) algorithm is employed jointly considering the spectrum, shape and CNN features of the segmented objects in HRRS images to judge whether the objects belong to impervious surfaces, thereby effectively increasing the accuracy of automatically extracting impervious surfaces. Two different experimental regions are selected from two different types of HRRS images (WorldView 2 and Pl√©iades-1A) respectively (4 experimental regions in all). The experimental results show that AEISHIDL has higher accuracy and automation level compared with other four representative methods in urban impervious surfaces extraction from HRRS images.}

Meanwhile, in order to simulate the inner interaction process in the human visual system (HVS) when perceiving the visual quality of stereoscopic images, we construct a two-channel DCNN to evaluate the visual quality of stereoscopic images. First, we design a Siamese Network to extract high-level semantic features of left- and right-view images for simulating the process of information extraction in the brain. Second, to imitate the information interaction process in the HVS, we combine the high-level features of left- and right-view images by convolutional operations. Finally, the information after interactive processing is used to estimate the visual quality of stereoscopic image. Experimental results show that the proposed method can estimate the visual quality of stereoscopic images accurately, which also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed two-channel convolutional neural network in simulating the perception mechanism in the HVS.}

Under this framework, we first propose a detection-based tubelet generation method which can generate tubelets with more accurate bounding boxes compared with traditional tracking-based methods. On the other hand, the latter can produce a higher recall of bounding boxes than the former in general. To take advantage of their complementary attributes, we further propose a novel tubelet fusion method to combine these multi-modal information (appearance information in independent images and contextual information in videos). Our extensive experiments on the well-known ILSVRC 2016 VID dataset show that our proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performances.}

abstract = {No-reference (NR) image quality assessment (IQA) aims to evaluate the quality of an image without reference image, which is greatly desired in the automatic visual signal processing system. Distortions degrade the visual contents and affect the semantics acquisition during the process of human perception. Although the existing methods evaluate the quality of images based on the structure, texture, or statistical characteristics, and deliver high quality prediction accuracy, they do not take the spatial semantics into account. From the perspective of human perception, distortions decrease the structural semantics that represent the structural information, and disturb the spatial semantics that describe the contents of images. Therefore, we attempt to measure the image quality by its degradation of semantics in an image. To extract the semantics of an image, a semantic network is proposed. The network contains convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) that correspond to structural semantics and spatial semantics, respectively. CNN can be regarded as a coarse imitation of human visual mechanism to obtain the structural information, and LSTM can express the contents of an image. Then, by measuring the degradations of different semantics on images, a novel NR IQA is introduced. The proposed approach is evaluated on the databases of LIVE, CSIQ, TID2013, and LIVE multiply distorted database as well as LIVE in the wild image quality challenge database, and the results show superior performance to other state-of-the-art NR IQA methods. Furthermore, we explore the generalization capability of the proposed approach, and the experimental results indicate the proposed approach has a high robustness.}

In the experiment, two locations with a viewing distance of 14.5‚ÄØkm were selected to place the laser and missile seeker detectors respectively.

Under the different target power density conditions, the simulation of the missile seeker head of the interference of the dizzy effect. By analyzing the interference images in the tracking state, the corresponding qualitative and quantitative dizziness interference results are obtained. After the calculation and analysis, it is considered that the laser energy output from the mid-wave infrared laser is 0.08‚ÄØmW/m2 when the power density of the target surface of the detector is 0.08‚ÄØmW/m2, respectively, under medium meteorological conditions with a visibility of 0.625.

The experimental data can provide theoretical guidance for the inversion and determination of parameters in the study of the medium wave infrared photoelectric countermeasure.}

It can regenerate any missing modality by sampling from the conditional distribution over the given data modality. The skeletal sequences are converted into the motion images which help us utilize the impressive power of the generative deep networks in the image processing. Furthermore, we use the variation of information (VI) as the training criterion, instead of the conventional maximum likelihood. It is proven that VI is efficient in cross-modal learning where some data modalities are missing. Our experimental results have shown that the model has an outstanding performance on the over-complete MHAD and CMU Mocap datasets in data-driven motion regeneration on a full-body 2D and 3D skeleton structures.}

For each iteration, as the input contains more correct information, the restoration algorithm can produce signals with more details. We have solved our boosting TGV model by primal-dual method, and applied the boosting TGV technique for gray/color image denoising and inpainting.

It is a hard task due to different illumination conditions, viewpoints and the small number of annotated individuals from each pair of cameras (small-sample-size problem). Common subspace learning methods have been proposed to handle the camera transition problems. However, after learning the low-dimensional representation, these methods usually compute distances using a simple cosine or Mahalanobis distance. Therefore, an still open question is how to better match probe and gallery images in the learned common subspace considering reduced number of training samples and the nonlinear behavior of the data. Collaborative Representation based Classification (CRC) has been employed successfully to address the small-sample-size problem in computer vision. However, the original CRC formulation is not well-suited for person re-identification since it does not consider that probe and gallery samples are from different cameras. Furthermore, it is a linear model, while appearance changes caused by different camera conditions indicate a strong nonlinear transition between cameras. To overcome such limitations, we propose the Kernel Cross-View Collaborative Representation based Classification (Kernel X-CRC), method that represents probe and gallery images by balancing representativeness and similarity nonlinearly. According to experimental results, we achieve state-of-the-art for rank-1 matching rates in three person re-identification datasets (CUHK03, PRID450S and GRID) and the second best results on VIPeR and CUHK01 datasets. Furthermore, we present outperforming results on Market-1501 dataset demonstrating that the Kernel X-CRC is suitable to a large-scale and multiple cameras scenario.}

The difference between P0 and P5 is defined, and the degree of the difference between P0 and P5 is calculated, so the final passenger flow P6 can be obtained. Finally, the Songjiang University Hall Station of Shanghai Metro line 9 was taken as an experimental analysis object, the high definition camera and WIFI probe are set up on the spot, the passenger flow video data and the WIFI data are collected synchronously, so the real-time passenger flow in the station's internal position is estimated, and the accuracy is corrected, meanwhile the passenger flow early warning of the station position is obtained.

Therefore, there is value in identifying the variations in water levels using observations from altimetry satellites and analyzing the possible causes. In this work, the water-level changes of Hulun Lake in Inner Mongolia during the period from 2002 to 2015 are monitored by the use of Jason satellite data, the results of which are compared with historical data. Landsat TM/ETM/OLI_TRIS remote sensing images are analyzed, and the surface area of the lake extracted from them and converted to the corresponding water level to verify the values obtained from the Jason observations. The results show a downward trend after 2000 (‚àí0.98‚ÄØmm/year) and a sharp increase after 2012 (3.07‚ÄØmm/year). The root mean square error (RMSE) between the two methods was 0.2369‚ÄØm, and the correlation coefficient was 0.986. By analyzing the various influencing factors, we draw the conclusion that the water level of Hulun Lake is affected by both natural factors (e.g., rainfall, runoff, evapotranspiration etc.) and anthropogenic influences (e.g., water consumption in coal mining, overgrazing, etc.). These are the main causes of the decrease in the area of Hulun Lake and other lakes in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. By comparing the lake storage anomalies of Hulun Lake with the terrestrial Total Water Storage anomalies (TWSA) inverted from GRACE satellite data and the Surface Water Storage anomalies (SWSA) from WaterGAP Global Hydrology Model (WGHM) within the Hulun Basin, we find that not only do Hulun Lake and basin interact with each other, but also that Hulun Lake has an important function with regards to the changes within the basin as a whole. This work therefore provides a method for monitoring the dynamic changes of lake water levels, while analyzing the influencing factors based on multi-scale data. Such a method shows potential for being applied to efforts to ensure environmental protection.}

The appropriate representation of an image is inconceivable by a single feature. Thus, the research addresses that point for content based image retrieval (CBIR) by fusing parametric color and shape features with nonparametric texture feature. The color moments, and moment invariants which are parametric methods and applied to describe color distribution and shapes of an image. The nonparametric ranklet transformation is performed to narrate the texture features. Experimentally these parametric and nonparametric features are integrated to propose a robust and effective algorithm. The proposed work is compared with seven existing techniques by determining statistical metrics across five image databases.

Then, local search is applied to merge parent and descendant populations. Only those individuals from the Pareto front are optimized. Experimental results suggest that this model and method is feasible and valid. Specifically, the VaR model is unable to estimate the possible extreme risk of a hedge fund. In contrast, the CVaR model can accurately measure the risks under extreme market conditions. However, a combination of VaR and CVaR can help a fund manager avoid extreme risks to a hedge fund.}

With ImmerTai, the Taichi expert‚Äôs motion is captured and delivered to remote students in CAVE, HMD and PC environments for learning. The students‚Äô motions are also captured for motion quality assessment and a group of students can form a virtual collaborative learning scenario. We built up a Taichi motion dataset with ground truth of motion quality, and based on this, we developed and evaluated several motion quality assessment methods. Then, user tests were designed and carried out to measure and compare the learning outcomes (learning time, quality and overall efficiency) of students in Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE), Head Mounted Display (HMD) and Personal Computer (PC) environments. Meanwhile, the connections between students‚Äô learning outcomes and their VR experience were investigated and discussed too. Our results show that ImmerTai can accelerate the learning process of students noticeably (up to 17%) compared to non-immersive learning with the conventional PC setup. However, we observed a substantial difference in the quality of the learnt motion between CAVE (26% gain) and HMD (23% drop) compared to PC (baseline). While strong VR presence can enhance the learning experience of students, their learning outcomes are not fully consistent to their experience. Overall, ImmerTai with CAVE demonstrated a significantly higher learning efficiency than other tested environments.}

A deep neural network architecture based on the MobileNet and feature pyramid structure is designed to detect targets directly on the fisheye raw images. Then, the target can be located based on the fisheye visual model and the attitude of the camera. Compared to traditional approaches, this approach has advantages in computational efficiency and accuracy. This approach is validated by experiments with a fisheye camera and an onboard computer on a micro-aerial vehicle (MAV).}

The lack of expressive ability of uncertain information makes it hard for FCM algorithm to handle clustered boundary pixels and outliers. This paper proposes a Neutrosophic C-means Clustering with local information and noise distance-based kernel metric for image segmentation (NKWNLICM). At first, noisy distance and fuzzy spatial information are introduced to NCM model to improve the robustness of noise image segmentation. Then, the kernel function is used to measure the distance between pixels. By mapping low-dimensional data into high-dimensional data, the classification performance is further improved. At last, the fuzzy factor is redefined based on the distance between the center pixel and its neighborhood. The new fuzzy factor can excellently reflect the influence of neighborhood pixels on central pixels and improve the classification accuracy much better. The experimental results on Berkeley Segmentation Database demonstrates the excellent performance of the proposed method for noisy image segmentation.}

At first, a tensor-based information model (TFS-Cube) of underlying features change in HSRS images is established. The wavelet texture feature change, spectral feature change and spatio-temporal autocorrelation coefficient of different-temporal related pixels are combined with three-order tensor, so as to make full use of the underlying features change information of HSRS images, optimize the organization mode and maintain the integrity of constraints between different underlying features. Secondly, a restricted Boltzmann Machine based on three-order tensor (Tensor3-RBM) is designed. The input, output and unsupervised learning of TFS-Cube tensor data are realized by multi-linear operations in Tensor3-RBMs. A large number of unlabeled samples are trained layer by layer through multilayer Tensor3-RBMs. Finally, the traditional BP neural network on the top layer of deep belief network (DBN) is replaced with support tensor machine (STM), and a deep belief network with multi-layer Tensor3-RBM and STM (TRS-DBN) is constructed. A small number of labeled samples are used for supervised learning and TRS-DBN global parameters optimization to improve the accuracy of TRS-DBN change detection. Two types of HSRS images from different sensors, AVIRIS and EO-1 Hyperion, are used as the data sources (double-temporal). Four representative experimental regions are randomly selected from the two areas covered by AVIRIS and EO-1 Hyperion HSRS images respectively (two regions in each area) to detect the land use changes. Experimental results demonstrate that TRS-DBN has higher change detection accuracy than similar methods and a good automation level.}

Inspired by the observation that the degree of defocus blur depth could be distinguished by different frequencies, a novel blur metric based on Multiscale SVD fusion (M-SVD) is proposed. The blur metric fuses different sub-bands of the selected singular values (SVs) in multiscale image windows, which could drastically reduce the chances of false positives for blur detection and overcome the difficulty that the sharp region is misjudged for a blur region because of its smooth texture. Finally, a blur map is applied on the test image combined with post-processing operation meanshift cluster to segment the blur region. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can detect the defocus blur regions of test images with a satisfactory performance and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.}

Recurrent 3D convolutional neural network is used to predict action categories and determine temporal boundaries of the generated tubes. We then introduce an action footprint map to refine the candidate tubes based on the action-specific spatial characteristics preserved in the convolutional layers of R3DCNN.

On one hand, for any qualified set, we can decode the secret image at pre-assigned probability. When we collect all the shares, we can losslessly decode the secret image. On the other hand, for any forbidden set, we will decode nothing of the secret image. We only employ modular operation to decode the secret image, which may be suitable for real-time and green computing scenarios. Experimental results and analyses are realized to examine the effectiveness of our scheme.}

Two specific instances of descriptor are presented and evaluated. The first, named AG, is real-valued, and uses 126 floating-point values to represent 126 effects. The second version, named AGS, is binarized, and uses 60 bytes to represent 240 effects, each with two bits. The first bit represents the sign of an effect value, while the second denotes whether the value is near or far from zero. We experimentally evaluate the proposed descriptors in combination with popular keypoint detectors on standard feature matching datasets. The extensive evaluation shows that AG and AGS achieve high score in several performance measures, and as such, they represent an attractive alternative to popular local descriptors.}

As a very special yet important case of object recognition, hand-held object recognition plays an important role in intelligence technology for its many applications such as visual question-answering and reasoning. In real-world scenarios, the datasets are open-ended and dynamic: new object samples and new object classes increase continuously. This requires the intelligence technology to enable hybrid incremental learning, which supports both data-incremental and class-incremental learning to efficiently learn the new information. However, existing work mainly focuses on one side of incremental learning, either data-incremental or class-incremental learning while do not handle two sides of incremental learning in a unified framework. To solve the problem, we present a Hybrid Incremental Learning (HIL) method based on Support Vector Machine (SVM), which can incrementally improve its recognition ability by learning new object samples and new object concepts during the interaction with humans. In order to integrate data-incremental and class-incremental learning into one unified framework, HIL adds the new classification-planes and adjusts existing classification-planes under the setting of SVM. As a result, our system can simultaneously improve the recognition quality of known concepts by minimizing the prediction error and transfer the previous model to recognize unknown objects. We apply the proposed method into hand-held object recognition and the experimental results demonstrated its advantage of HIL. In addition, we conducted extensive experiments on the subset of ImageNet and the experimental results further validated the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

We assume a rough correspondence between the object and shadow points and use Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to simultaneously calculate the transformation parameters and categorize rough correspondences as inliers or outliers. To enhance the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, we extend the proposed algorithm to handle the ambiguity in initial correspondence by using the one-to-many correspondence strategy.

Recent techniques of super-resolution for single monochrome images develop rapidly, but for single multi-color images, to efficiently apply the monochrome super-resolution algorithms to all channels is still under exploration. In most of the recent research, the chromatic channels are simply upscaled by interpolation, which leads to the quality of the chromatic channels downgraded. This application may not be noticed by the visual systems of humans, but can affect other algorithms when super-resolution plays roles at image pre-processing. In this paper, we present a novel approach for multi-color super-resolution reconstruction. Using the super-resolution reconstructed luminance channel as the guide image, we adopt guided filters to manage the interpolated chromatic channels. Guided filters retain the sharp edges and fine details from the guided image and carry them to the output images. Meanwhile the whole process is quite computationally economic. Extensive experiments on natural images show that our method achieves better results than the method that is used in most of the algorithm in the literature in both statistic and visual aspects.}

abstract = {Learning based hashing have been widely adopted to the approximate nearest neighbour search in large-scale image retrieval. However, how to preserve the semantic information in hashing embedding is still a challenge problem. Moreover, most of the existing methods employ the relaxation strategy to solve discrete constraint problem, which may accumulate binary quantization error as the coding length increases. In this paper, we propose a graph-based supervised hashing framework to address these problems, where the semantic information is preserved from two aspects. On one hand, we employ a supervised learning model to keep the semantic consistency. On the other hand, the intrinsic manifold structure is captured by a graph-based model. In addition, to reduce the quantization error, we adopt a discrete optimization strategy to replace the relaxation one. Experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.}

More specifically, acoustic features highly representative to both emotion and phoneme tags are selected under a multi-task learning framework. Based on this, speech phoneme and emotion sequences are effectively calculated. Then, an active learning algorithm is developed to discover the key facial frames representative to both the phoneme and emotion tags. Finally, we associate each phoneme‚ÄØ+‚ÄØemotion tuple with a key facial frame. And a popular morphing algorithm is employed to fit them into a coherent animation video.

Firstly, we predict regional scene depth by a upsampling deep dense network (DenseNet). Secondly, we simultaneously estimate edgel occlusion with logistic regression. However, the occlusion relationship always suffers from unexpected conflicts due to noisy regional and edgel cues. Therefore, we finally infer occlusion relationship in a Hidden Markov Field (HMF), which tackles conflicts with bi-direction inference and the HMF parameters are exploited by iterative EM-like procedure.

A spatiotemporal similarity function is developed to construct a similarity matrix based on the visual features. Video frames are represented by the sparse matrix as graph vertices based on an objective function, where Highly Connected Subgraphs (HCS) are constructed as clusters. Finally, events are obtained from such clusters assuming that the centroid of the cluster is a key-frame of the event. Consequently, this approach does not require assumption to determine the number of clusters. Due to this advantage, users can select the number of keyframes without incurring an extra computational cost. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art models on Precision and F-measure and also cover the major contents of the original video.}

Before questioning the intention behind the editing operations, we need to first identify how and which part of the image has been manipulated.

This survey provides an overview on typical image tampering types, released image tampering datasets and recent tampering detection approaches.

We propose an adversarial learning framework, which can learn invariant human pose latent from 3D annotated datasets to optimize the estimation of monocular images with only 2D annotations. However there is large difference in observation coordinates between 2D datasets and 3D datasets, and this viewpoints issue should be separated from invariant pose latent. We add a viewpoints invariant module to automatically regulate observation viewpoints for generated 3D pose, which transforming the generated pose to more suitable observation in the 3D datasets.

In the proposed algorithm, a new adaptive plateau limit and a new edge-enhancing transformation function are proposed. The adaptive plateau limit makes the method robust to various histogram distributions, and the edge-enhancing transformation enhances edges while suppressing noise amplification in the flat region. The performance of the various HE algorithms are evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively. The qualitative assessment shows that the proposed algorithm avoids over-enhancement and noise amplification, effectively. In addition, the quantitative metrics show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing HE algorithms in terms of local contrast, discrete entropy, and perceptual sharpening index.}

Thus, it is a major challenge for HDR video coding to efficiently compress them without sacrificing perceptual quality. Perceptual Quantizer (PQ) transfer function provides a solution to this problem, which is adopted as the HEVC Main 10 Profile-based Anchor. However, PQ is not adaptive to HDR contents, thus reducing the coding efficiency. In this paper, we propose adaptive transfer function based on PQ for HDR video compression, called adaptive PQ. Different from PQ which uses a fixed mapping curve from luminance to luma, the proposed transfer function adaptively maps luminance to luma according to HDR contents. Thus, adaptive PQ is able to efficiently utilize possible luma values. Moreover, adaptive PQ achieves better perceptual uniformity in the luminance range than PQ. Experimental results demonstrate that adaptive PQ achieves a significant performance improvement in HDR video coding over PQ in terms of visual quality and bitrate.}

The compression of HEVC/SHVC is efficiently improved and supports ultra-high resolution (UHD). Therefore, the coding complexity of HEVC/SHVC is much higher than those of previous standards. The framework of SHVC is based on HEVC and is divided into several types of scalable video. SHVC can be decoded into various video resolutions, frame rates and qualities, and only needs to be encoded once, but with higher complexity than HEVC. Thus, how to reduce the coding complexity of SHVC is the purpose of this paper. Our proposed algorithm accelerates the enhancement layer (EL) prediction by utilizing encoded Coding Unit (CU) sizes, prediction modes, motion vectors and Rate-Distortion Costs (RD-Costs) of the base layer (BL) and encoded CU sizes of the enhancement layer for quality scalability of SHVC. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can save lots of time while maintaining good video quality, and the performance is better than those of previous works.}

In this study, a three-dimensional spatial particle filter tracking method was proposed, and multi-vision joint tracking and collaboration were effectively achieved. This method was based on the existing particle filter framework. A two-dimensional plane particle was taken as the projection of a three-dimensional spatial particle on the imaging plane, and the formula for calculating a spatial particle‚Äôs weight was derived based on Bayesian posterior probability recursion. In addition, an approximation method to determine spatial particle weight was given. The resampling of spatial particles was performed by using an epipolar line resampling method, and a collaborative tracking mechanism was established based on the concept of resolution. The results showed that the proposed method had higher tracking precision and anti-occlusion performance than other existing methods.

Many research efforts have been devoted to multimedia annotation to further improve the performance. However, the prevailing methods are designed for single-media annotation task. In fact, heterogeneous media content describes given labels from respective modality and is complementary to each other, and it becomes critical to explore advanced techniques for heterogeneous data analysis and multimedia annotation. Inspired by this idea, this paper presents a new multimodal correlation learning method for heterogeneous multimedia cooperative annotation, named unified space learning, which projects heterogeneous media data into one unified space. We formulate the multimedia annotation task into a semi-supervised learning framework, in which we learn different projection matrices for different media type. By doing so, different media content is aligned cooperatively, and jointly provides a more complementary profile of given semantic labels. Experimental results on data set with images, audio clips, videos and 3D models show that the proposed approach is more effective.}

To overcome MGM problems, in this paper, a new multilevel augmentation method (MAM) in order to solve discrete linear system is proposed. Applying the special matrix splitting techniques, approximate solution is obtained by (1) solving a linear system only at an initial lower level; (2) compensating the error by directly computing the product of matrices and vectors at the higher level without any iterations.

In this paper, we propose a new hybrid feature representation for the recognition of facial expressions from a single image frame that uses a combination of SIFT and deep-learning feature of different level extracted from the CNN model, then adopt the combined features and classify the expression by support vector machines (SVM). The performance of the proposed method has been validated on public CK+ databases. To evaluate the generalization ability of our method, we also performed an experiment on a cross-database environment.

For the convenience of research, the complex structure of rock and soil is often neglected, and the geotechnical material is regarded as a macro continuum. On this basis, a new method is used, X-ray CT scale cracks, crack size is larger than the micro-scale cracks, the number of cracks is less, but geotechnical CT images can still show the crack initiation location, propagation path, through the process, cracks and the relationship between aggregate mortar. When CT-scale microcracks can be found, the length of microcracks is equal to the magnitude of aggregate-scale, and can be compared with numerical simulation results. In this paper, four different kinds of soil samples are selected to design relevant tests. The specific effects of CT scanning parameters on CT images of rock and soil samples are studied by direct and indirect methods combined with CT number curves under different scanning conditions. The results show that the scanning voltage and filtering function have great influence on CT images and CT numbers of rock and soil samples. The enhancement or inhibition of the filtering function to the geotechnical CT image depends on the property of the selected filtering function, but has nothing to do with the soil quality of the sample. Finally, the selection principle of the CT scanning parameters is given. With the help of reasonable CT scanning parameters, the quality of the geotechnical CT image can be improved and the relatively accurate geotechnical CT value can be obtained.}

abstract = {In this paper, a robust re-ranking method based on expanded k-reciprocal neighbors is proposed. Our method assumes that if a gallery image is the probe image of the expanded k-reciprocal nearest neighbors, these images are more likely to be of the same person. Specifically, given a probe image, we replace the probe with its expanded reciprocal nearest neighbor and the final distance is computed by the mean value of the corresponding neighbor set. The proposed method is unsupervised, automatic and applicable to other person re-identification problems. Moreover, our method can perform well even with a simple direct rank list where the Euclidean distance was used to compute the distances between the images. Experiments on many public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our re-ranking method. The proposed method achieves 4.9% improvement in Rank-1 on the CUHK03 dataset and a significant improvement of 18.6% in mAP on the Duke dataset.}

The proposed method takes full advantage of the spatial correlation in the original images to vacate room for embedding data before image encryption. By jointly using an extended run-length coding and a block-based most significant bit (MSB) plane rearrangement mechanism, the MSB planes of images can be compressed efficiently to generate room for high-capacity embedding. The receiver can extract data directly from encrypted images with only the data hiding key, and the original image or the high-quality plain image that contains secret data can be recovered with only the encryption key. The experimental results prove that the proposed method can reach a high embedding rate and a high PSNR.}

Many intelligent video surveillance systems were proposed in recent years. They achieved good performance to some extent. Since power station is an important field, it is important to develop an intelligent video surveillance. Considering that detecting the whole surveillance video is time consumption and computation. So in this paper, we propose an active defense system to find intruders automatically. First, a key frame selection algorithm based on adaptive features is presented to select key frames. These key frames can cover the main content of videos and detecting these key frames can also reduce time consumption and computation. Then, a probabilistic model is proposed to learn the training data distribution. Finally, our system can achieve active defense based on probabilistic model. Experimental results show that our active defense system can achieve finding intruders effectively.}

In this work, we propose the Scene Graph Captioner (SGC) framework for the image captioning task, which captures the comprehensive structural semantic of visual scene by explicitly modeling objects, attributes of objects, and relationships between objects. Firstly, we develop an approach to generate the scene graph by learning individual modules on the large object, attribute and relationship datasets. Then, SGC incorporates high-level graph information and visual attention information into a deep captioning framework. Specifically, we propose a novel framework to embed a scene graph into the structural representation, which captures the semantic concepts and the graph topology. Further, we develop the scene-graph-driven method to generate the attention graph by exploiting high internal homogeneity and external inhomogeneity among the nodes in the scene graph. Finally, a LSTM-based framework translates these information into text. We evaluate the proposed framework on a held-out MSCOCO dataset.}

It is similar to image completion, which is shown to benefit from larger receptive fields in recent deep neural network based methods.

To this end, we propose a joint residual pyramid model by introducing residual blocks and linear interpolation layers into the convolutional neural pyramid (CNP), and adopting the CNP in the joint super-resolution framework. Our model consists of three sub-networks, two for feature extraction concatenated by another for image reconstruction. Experimental results show that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms not only on data pairs of RGB/depth images, but also on data pairs like color/saliency and color-scribbles/colorized images, without significantly sacrificing computation efficiency and memory space.}

Instead of selecting suitable position to embed secret messages, we then employ the syndrome-trellis code to minimize the embedding distortion and get messages embedded.

Generally, DCF based trackers assume that the target can be well shaped by an axis-aligned bounding box. Therefore, in terms of irregularly shaped objects, the learned correlation filter is unavoidably deteriorated by the background pixels inside the bounding box. To tackle this problem, we propose Target-Aware Correlation Filters (TACF) for visual tracking. A target likelihood map is introduced to impose discriminative weight on filter values according to the probability of this location belonging to the foreground target. According to the TACF formulation, we further propose an optimization strategy based on the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient method for efficient filter learning. With hand-crafted features (HOG), our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance (62.8% AUC) on OTB100 while running in real-time (24 fps) on a single CPU. With shallow convolutional features, our approach achieves 66.7% AUC on OTB100 and the top rank in EAO on the VOT2016 challenge.}

In the local network, frames from unrecognized video are aggregated into a single frame by a novel method, LEMHI. This approach improves MHI by using detected human facial landmarks as attention areas to boost local value in difference image calculation, so that the action of crucial facial unit can be captured effectively. Then this single frame will be fed into a CNN network for prediction. On the other hand, an improved CNN-LSTM model is used as a global feature extractor and classifier for video facial emotion recognition in the global network. Finally, a random search weighted summation strategy is conducted as late-fusion fashion to final predication. Our work also offers an insight into networks and visible feature maps from each layer of CNN to decipher which portions of the face influence the networks‚Äô predictions. Experiments on the AFEW, CK+ and MMI datasets using subject-independent validation scheme demonstrate that the integrated framework of two networks achieves a better performance than using individual network separately.

abstract = {Crowd behavior analysis has become one of the new areas of interest in the computer vision community due to the increasing demands from surveillance and security industries. It is important to meticulously understand crowd behavior to prevent any disaster and unwanted incidents such as thief, stampede and riots. For this purpose, crowd features such as density, motion and trajectory are analyzed to detect any abnormality in the crowd. Thus, this review is aimed to provide insight on several detection methods including Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Hidden Markov Model (HMM), Optical Flow method and Spatio-Temporal Technique (STT). Providing the latest development, the review presented the studies that are published in journals and conferences over the past 5‚ÄØyears.}

abstract = {Soil-rock mixture (S/RM) is a very complex discontinuous medium material, which is a multiphase system consisting of high strength rock blocks (Rocks), relatively soft filling components (Soils) and corresponding pores. Because the mechanical properties of various components of soil-rock mixtures under external loads are very different, and there are extremely complex interactions between them. Therefore, the mechanical properties of this geotechnical material (such as stress transfer, failure mode, crack propagation, bearing capacity, etc.) are quite different from those of homogeneous geotechnical materials, and largely depend on the internal structure characteristics of soil-rock mixtures (such as particle size composition, particle shape, particle distribution and arrangement). Due to the complexity of the model, the simulation of its meso-mechanical properties is mostly confined to the random simulation of regular blocks. In this paper, an automatic generation method of PFC‚àº2D numerical model of soil-rock mixture microstructure based on digital image processing is proposed, and the experimental simulation is carried out with matlab. Thus, the rapid, real and automatic modeling of heterogeneous material microstructure by PFC‚àº2D software is realized. The PFC‚àº2D numerical calculation model of soil-rock mixtures is established. The results show that when the stone content is 80%, the analysis should be caused by the large amount of rock, which leads to the large internal voids, and the sudden unloading between the rock and the rock during compaction and then the structural reorganization.}
