abstract = {Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) is a difficult task due to the challenges of discriminative feature learning. Most existing methods directly use the final output of the network which always contains the global feature with high-level semantic information. However, the differences between fine-grained images are reflected in subtle local regions which often appear in the front of the network. When the texture of the background and object are similar or the proportion of the background is too large, the prediction will be greatly affected. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes multi-granularity feature fusion module (MGFF) and two-stage classification based on Vision-Transformer (ViT). The former comprehensively represents images by fusing features of different granularities, thus avoiding the limitations of single-scale features. The latter leverages the ViT model to separate the object from the background at a very small cost, thereby improving the accuracy of the prediction. We conduct comprehensive experiments and achieves the best performance in two fine-grained tasks on CUB-200-2011 and NA-Birds.}

abstract = {Unpaired image-to-image translation among category domains has achieved remarkable success in past decades. Recent studies mainly focus on two challenges. For one thing, such translation is inherently multi-modal (i.e. many-to-many mapping) due to variations of domain-specific information (e.g., the domain of house cat contains multiple sub-modes), which is usually addressed by predefined distribution sampling. For another, most existing multi-modal approaches have limits in handling more than two domains with one model, i.e. they have to independently build two distributions to capture variations for every pair of domains. To address these problems, we propose a Hierarchical Image-to-image Translation (HIT) method which jointly formulates the multi-domain and multi-modal problem in a semantic hierarchy structure by modeling a common and nested distribution space. Specifically, domains have inclusion relationships under a particular hierarchy structure. With the assumption of Gaussian prior for domains, distributions of domains at lower levels capture the local variations of their ancestors at higher levels, leading to the so-called nested distributions. To this end, we propose a nested distribution loss in light of the distribution divergence measurement and information entropy theory to characterize the aforementioned inclusion relations among domain distributions. Experiments on ImageNet, ShapeNet, and CelebA datasets validate the promising results of our HIT against state-of-the-arts, and as additional benefits of nested modeling, one can even control the uncertainty of multi-modal translations at different hierarchy levels.}

abstract = {Image filtering under guidance image, known as guided filtering (GF), has been successfully applied to a variety of applications. Existing GF methods utilize either conventional full window-based framework (FWF) or simple uniformly weighted aggregation strategy (UWA); thereby they suffer from edge-blurring. In this paper, based upon gradient guided filtering (GGF), a weighted side-window based gradient guided filtering (WSGGF) is proposed to address the aforementioned problem. First, both regression and adaptive regularization terms in GGF are improved upon eight side windows by introducing side window-based framework (SWF). L1 norm is adopted to choose the results calculated in side windows. Second, UWA strategy in GGF is replaced by a refined variance-based weighted average (VWA) aggregation. In VWA, the value of each weight is chosen inversely proportional to the corresponding estimator. We show that with these improvements our method can well retain the edge sharpness and is robust to visual artifacts. To cut down the time consumption, a fast version of WSGGF (FWSGGF) is further proposed by incorporating a simple but effective down-sampling strategy, which is about four times faster while maintaining the superior performance. By comparing with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on edge-aware smoothing, detail enhancement, high dynamic range image (HDR) compression, image luminance adjustment, depth map upsampling and single image haze removal, the effectiveness and flexibility of our proposed methods are verified.

Our local PCA method is an online neural network method where unit centers and shapes are modified after the presentation of each data point. For several benchmark distributions, we demonstrate that our method improves the overall quality of clustering, especially for high-dimensional distributions where many conventional methods do not perform satisfactorily.

The triple-modal interaction encoder comprises the separation context-aware feature module, channel-wise fusion module, and triple-modal refinement and fusion module, enabling us to fully explore and utilize the complementarity between Visible, Depth, and Thermal information.

Most of the existing works adopt distillation-based methods, which focus on pushing new features to imitate the distribution of the old ones. However, the distillation-based methods are intrinsically sub-optimal since it forces the new feature space to imitate the inferior old feature space. To address this issue, we propose the Ranking-based Backward Compatible Learning (RBCL), which directly optimizes the ranking metric between new features and old features. Different from previous methods, RBCL only pushes the new features to find best-ranking positions in the old feature space instead of strictly alignment, and is in line with the ultimate goal of backward retrieval. However, the sharp sigmoid function used to make the ranking metric differentiable also incurs the gradient vanish issue, therefore stems the ranking refinement during the later period of training. To address this issue, we propose the Dynamic Gradient Reactivation (DGR), which can reactivate the suppressed gradients by adding dynamically computed constants during the forward step. To further help target the best-ranking positions, we include the Neighbor Context Agents (NCAs) to approximate the entire old feature space during training. Unlike previous works that mainly test on the in-domain settings, we make the early attempt to introduce the cross-domain settings (including both supervised and unsupervised) for the backward compatible person Re-ID task, which are more challenging yet meaningful. The experimental results on all five settings show that the proposed RBCL outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins.}

Most of the existing OSR methods are inductive methods, which generally suffer from the domain shift problem that the learned model from the known-class domain might be unsuitable for the unknown-class domain. Addressing this problem, inspired by the success of transductive learning for alleviating the domain shift problem in many other visual tasks, we propose an Iterative Transductive OSR framework, called IT-OSR, which implements three explored modules iteratively, including a reliability sampling module, a feature generation module, and a baseline update module. Specifically at the initialization stage, a baseline method, which could be an arbitrary inductive OSR method, is used for assigning pseudo labels to the test samples. At the iteration stage, based on the consistency of the assigned pseudo labels between the output/logit space and the latent feature space of the baseline method, a dual-space consistent sampling approach is presented in the reliability sampling module for sampling some reliable ones from the test samples. Then in the feature generation module, a conditional dual-adversarial generative network is designed to generate discriminative features of both known and unknown classes. This generative network employs two discriminators for implementing fake/real and known/unknown-class discriminations respectively. And it is trained by jointly utilizing the test samples with their pseudo labels selected in the reliability sampling module and the labeled training samples. Finally in the baseline update module, the above baseline method is updated/re-trained for sample re-prediction by jointly utilizing the generated features, the selected test samples with pseudo labels, and the training samples. Extensive experimental results on both the standard-dataset and the cross-dataset settings demonstrate that the derived transductive methods, by introducing two typical inductive OSR methods into the proposed IT-OSR framework, achieve better performances than 19 state-of-the-art methods in most cases.}

Secondly, the learning procedure of the multi-layer perception (MLP) in the feed forward network (FFN) is lack of local interaction information among samples. To address the above issues, a new self-attention learning method, fineâcoarse concatenated attention (FCA), is proposed to learn self-attention with fine and coarse granularity information. Moreover, the cross-concatenation MLP (CC-MLP) is developed to capture local interaction information across samples. Based on the two proposed modules, a novel encoder and decoder are constructed, and augmented in an all-attention tracking algorithm, FCAT. Comprehensive experiments on popular tracking datasets, OTB2015, LaSOT, GOT-10K and TrackingNet, reveal the effectiveness of FCA and CC-MLP, and FCAT achieves the state-of-art on the datasets.}

The diffusion process (or data smoothing in its spatial domain) removes fine details in order to capture the structure and important patterns in data but it suppresses the capability of GANs to learn high-frequency information in the training procedure. Based on these observations, we propose a data representation for the GAN training, called noisy scale-space (NSS), that recursively applies the smoothing with a balanced noise to data in order to replace the high-frequency information by random data, leading to a coarse-to-fine training of GANs. We experiment with NSS using DCGAN and StyleGAN2 based on benchmark datasets in which the NSS-based GANs outperforms the state-of-the-arts in most cases.}

Unlike previous CNN-based style transfer frameworks, this formulation naturally enables accurate pixel-wise stylization control. In addition, to give explicit controllability on the degree of stylization, we define two vectors that represent the content and style respectively, enabling control by interpolating these vectors.

With the hypothesis that semantic feature can be shared across domains, this paper proposes a coarse-to-fine online matching architecture (COM) for one-stage domain adaptation. We consider subsequent learning stages progressively refining the task in the latent feature space, i.e. the finer set at each component is hierarchically derived from the coarser set of the previous components, including cross-domain global prototypes, categories and instances matching and anchor-points contrastive learning, which further achieve self-supervised learning with region-level pseudo label generated only in a single training step. Beforehand, feature refinement are performed to realize edge perception and inter-feature augmentation. Then, coarse-to-fine network fuses global and local consistency matching via specific distribution alignment between the source and target domain. Finally, the adversarial structure controls the uncertainty of generator prediction through the maximization of classification results and minimization of two classifiers discrepancy. This proposed method is evaluated in two unsupervised domain adaptation tasks, i.e. GTA5 â Cityscapes and SYNTHIA â Cityscapes. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our proposed COM model and demonstrate its superiority over several state-of-the-art approaches.}

abstract = {Video super-resolution can reconstruct a sequence of high-resolution frames with temporally consistent contents from their corresponding low-resolution sequences. The key challenge for this task is how to effectively utilize both inter-frame temporal relations and intra-frame spatial relations. The existing methods for super-resolving the videos commonly estimate optical flows to align the features of multiple frames based on temporal correlations. However, motion estimation is often error-prone and hence largely hinders the recovery of plausible details. Moreover, high-order contextual dependencies in the feature space are rarely exploited for further enhancing the spatio-temporal information fusion. To this end, we propose a novel generative adversarial network to super-resolve low-resolution videos, which makes full use of patch embeddings and is effective in exploring high-order spatio-temporal relations of the feature patches. Specifically, a motion-aware relation module is designed to handle the alignment between neighboring frames and reference ones. Depending on a patch-matching strategy for adaptive selection of multiple most similar patches, the cross-scale graph is constructed to reliably aggregate these patches using a feature pyramid. Based on the structure of multi-scale graph, a context-aware relation module is developed to capture high-order dependencies among resulting warped patches for better leveraging long-range complementary contexts. To further enhance reconstruction ability, the temporal position information of video sequences is also encoded into this module. Dual discriminators with cycle consistent constraints are adopted to provide more informative feedback to the generator while maintaining the global coherence. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of quantitative and qualitative evaluation metrics.}

The motivation behind this paper is that edge information driving the contour evolution can be iteratively obtained by incomplete CS measurements. In each iteration, the CS-GAC is a three-step process including edge detection, active contouring and sparse reconstruction. Instead of working on the final reconstructed images themselves, the evolution of the CS-GAC is driven by a few CS measurements and guided by updatable edge information. The edge information is generated by a complex shearlet transform (CST) based edge map. In the framework, reconstruction and edge detection work alternately. The iterative update property that takes advantages of both edge sparsity and edge detection can largely improve the evolution precision. Numerical experiments show that the CS-GAC can obtain challenging segmentation results in comparisons with the state of the art methods, and has competitive prospects.}

One key factor of GNNâs success is the smoothness property on node representations. Despite this, most GNN models are fragile to the perturbations on graph inputs and could learn unreliable node representations. In this paper, we study how to learn node representations against perturbations in GNN. Specifically, we consider that a node representation should remain stable under slight perturbations on the input, and node representations from different structures should be identifiable, which two are termed as the stability and identifiability on node representations, respectively. To this end, we propose a novel model called Stability-Identifiability GNN Against Perturbations (SIGNNAP) that learns reliable node representations in an unsupervised manner. SIGNNAP formalizes the stability and identifiability by a contrastive objective and preserves the smoothness with existing GNN backbones. The proposed method is a generic framework that can be equipped with many other backbone models (e.g. GCN, GraphSage and GAT). Extensive experiments on six benchmarks under both transductive and inductive learning setups of node classification demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

We define shape and propose a new behavioral metric to measure the extent to which a CNN utilizes shape information. We then execute a set of experiments with synthetic and real-world data to progressively uncover under which circumstances CNNs learn shape and what can be done to encourage such behavior. We conclude that (i) CNNs do not learn shape in typical settings but rather rely on other features available to identify the objects of interest, (ii) CNNs can learn shape, but only if the shape is the only feature available to identify the object, (iii) sufficiently large receptive field size relative to the size of target objects is necessary for shape learning; (iv) a limited set of augmentations can encourage shape learning; (v) learning shape is indeed useful in the presence of out-of-distribution data.}

abstract = {Automatic Speaker Verification (ASV) is a critical task in pattern recognition and has been applied to various security-sensitive scenarios. The current state-of-the-art technique for ASV is based on deep embedding. However, a significant challenge with this approach is that the resulting deep speaker vectors tend to be irregularly distributed. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel training method called Maximum Gaussianality (MG), which regulates the distribution of the speaker vectors. Compared to the conventional normalization approach based on maximum likelihood (ML), the new approach directly maximizes the Gaussianality of the latent codes, and therefore can both normalize the between-class and within-class distributions in a controlled and reliable way and eliminate the unbound likelihood problem associated with the conventional ML approach. Our experiments on several datasets demonstrate that our MG-based normalization can deliver much better performance than the baseline systems without normalization and outperform discriminative normalization flow (DNF), an ML-based normalization method, particularly when the training data is limited. In theory, the MG criterion can be applied to any task in any research domain where Gaussian distributions are needed, making the MG training a versatile tool.}

abstract = {Weakly supervised person search aims to perform joint pedestrian detection and re-identification (re-id) with only bounding-box annotations. Recently, the idea of contrastive learning is initially applied to weakly supervised person search, where two common contrast strategies are memory-based contrast and intra-image contrast. We argue that current intra-image contrast is shallow, which suffers from spatial-level and occlusion-level variance. In this paper, we present a novel deep intra-image contrastive learning using a Siamese network. Two key modules are spatial-invariant contrast (SIC) and occlusion-invariant contrast (OIC). SIC performs many-to-one contrasts between two branches of Siamese network and dense prediction contrasts in one branch of Siamese network. With these many-to-one and dense contrasts, SIC tends to learn discriminative scale-invariant and location-invariant features to solve spatial-level variance. OIC enhances feature consistency with the masking strategy to learn occlusion-invariant features. Extensive experiments are performed on two person search datasets. Our method achieves a state-of-the-art performance among weakly supervised one-step person search approaches.}

Especially in medical applications, because patientsâ examinations depend on their health status, observations in this event-based medical time series are nonuniformly distributed. When using deep learning models to classify ISTS, most work defines the problem that needs to be solved as alignment-caused data missing or nonuniformity-caused dependency change. However, they only modeled relationships between observed values, ignoring the fact that time is the independent variable for a time series. In this paper, we emphasize that irregularity is active, time-depended, and class-associated and is reflected in the Time Pattern (TP). To this end, this paper focused on the TP of ISTS for the first time, proposing a Time Pattern Reconstruction (TPR) method. It first encodes time information by the time encoding mechanism, then imputes values from time codes by the continuous-discrete Kalman network, selects key time points by the conditional masking mechanism, and finally classifies ISTS based on the reconstructed TP. Experiments on four real-world medical datasets and three other datasets show that TPR outperforms all baselines. We also show that TP can reveal biomarkers and key time points for diseases.}

However, existing SSDA work fails to make full use of label information from both source and target domains for feature alignment across domains, resulting in label mismatch in the label space during model testing. This paper presents a novel SSDA approach, Inter-domain Mixup with Neighborhood Expansion (IDMNE), to tackle this issue. Firstly, we introduce a cross-domain feature alignment strategy, Inter-domain Mixup, that incorporates label information into model adaptation. Specifically, we employ sample-level and manifold-level data mixing to generate compatible training samples. These newly established samples, combined with reliable and actual label information, display diversity and compatibility across domains, while such extra supervision thus facilitates cross-domain feature alignment and mitigates label mismatch. Additionally, we utilize Neighborhood Expansion to leverage high-confidence pseudo-labeled samples in the target domain, diversifying the label information of the target domain and thereby further increasing the performance of the adaptation model. Accordingly, the proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant accuracy improvements on popular SSDA benchmarks, including DomainNet, Office-Home, and Office-31.}

The transmission map is derived as a function of two saturations of the original image in the two color spaces.

These two values are estimated from a given low-light image using the gamma correction prior. In addition, a pixel-adaptive gamma value determination algorithm is proposed to prevent under- or over-enhancement. The proposed algorithm is fast because it does not require the training or refinement process.

Inspired by Newtonâs law of universal gravitation, we propose a NaN search algorithm based on universal gravitation (GNaN-Searching). Our algorithm calculates gravitation using the structural features of data points in the dataset, it utilizes the gravitation between data as the neighbor judgment criterion, and inherits the no-parameter and dynamic neighborhood characteristics of the NaN search algorithm.

The gated convolutions enable the selective extraction of stroke feature with different attention. Our proposed framework comprises two stages. Firstly, a coarse sub-network with an extra edge branch is trained to enhance the precision of feature maps by incorporating a priori mask and edge information. Secondly, a refinement sub-network is cascaded to enhance the output of the first stage using gated convolutions based on the sharp edges. To effectively incorporate global information, GDB also integrates a parallelized multi-scale operation that combines local and global features. We conduct comprehensive experiments on ten Document Image Binarization Contest (DIBCO) datasets from 2009 to 2019 and Document Deblurring Datasets.

Traditional strategies cannot tackle the irregular variations of object and the sampling noise, so it is quite risky to adopt them to update Siamese trackers. In this paper, we present a two-stage one-shot learner by exploring the learning scheme of Siamese network, which reveals there are two key issues during online update, i.e., feature fusion and feature comparison. Based on this finding, we propose an updatable Siamese tracker by introducing two independent transformers (SiamTOL). Concretely, a Cross-aware transformer is designed to combine the features of the initial and the dynamic templates, while a Decoder-favored transformer is exploited to compare the fusing template and the search region. By combining these transformers, our tracker is able to adequately model the feature dependencies between multi-frame object samples. Extensive experimental results on several popular benchmarks well manifest that the proposed approach achieves the leading performance, and outperforms other state-of-the-art trackers.}

This is refined by jointly modeling the relationship between neighboring pixels and connectivity to further enhance the estimated centerline and produce a graph of the structure. The proposed approach is evaluated on a diverse range of problems, including crack detection, road mapping and superficial vein centerline detection from infrared/ color images, improving over the state-of-the-art by 2.1%, 10.9% and 17.3%/ 4.6% respectively in terms of quality, demonstrating its generalizability and performance in a wide range of mapping problems.}

This is critical for meeting particular data sharing, privacy, and license constraints, whilst raising novel algorithmic challenges. Existing source-free domain adaptation methods rely on either generating pseudo samples/prototypes of source or target domain style, or simply leveraging pseudo-labels (self-training). They suffer from low-quality generated samples/prototypes or noisy pseudo-label target samples. In this work, we address both limitations by introducing a novel Class Prototype Discovery (CPD) method. In contrast to all alternatives, our CPD is established on a set of semantic class prototypes each constructed for representing a specific class. By designing a classification score based prototype learning mechanism, we reformulate the source-free domain adaptation problem to class prototype optimization using all the target domain training data, and without the need for data generation. Then, class prototypes are used to cluster target features to assign them pseudo-labels, which highly complements the conventional self-training strategy. Besides, a prototype regularization is introduced for exploiting well-established distribution alignment based on pseudo-labeled target samples and class prototypes. Along with theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive experiments on three standard benchmarks to validate the performance advantages of our CPD over the state-of-the-art models.}

However, to achieve this, the state-of-the-art methods require either subsequently learning mapping functions to seek similar motions or training the model repetitively to enable control over the desired portion of body. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to learn disentangled representations for controllable human motion prediction. Our task is to predict multiple future human motions based on the past observed sequence, with the control of partial-body movements. Our network involves a conditional variational auto-encoder (CVAE) architecture to model full-body human motion, and an extra CVAE path to learn only the corresponding partial-body (e.g., lower-body) motion. Specifically, the inductive bias imposed by the extra CVAE path encourages two latent variables in two paths to respectively govern separate representations for each partial-body motion. With a single training, our model is able to provide two types of controls for the generated human motions: (i) strictly controlling one portion of human body and (ii) adaptively controlling the other portion, by sampling from a pair of latent spaces. Additionally, we extend and adapt a sampling strategy to our trained model to diversify the controllable predictions. Our framework also potentially allows new forms of control by flexibly customizing the input for the extra CVAE path. Extensive experimental results and ablation studies demonstrate that our approach is capable of predicting state-of-the-art controllable human motions both qualitatively and quantitatively.}

To circumvent this difficulty, an innovative multi-task framework is proposed in this work to integrate self-supervision and self-distillation to tackle PLL problem. Specifically, in the self-distillation task, cross-sample knowledge in the same batch is utilized to refine ensembled soft targets to supervise the distillation operation without using multiple networks. The auxiliary self-supervised task of recognizing rotation transformations of images provides more supervisory signal for feature learning.

abstract = {Deep learning (DL)-based models especially Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models have recently achieved great success in medical image classifications. It is usually time-consuming and labor-intensive to train a practical classification model due to the requirement of large data volume. Since medical images are more difficult to acquire and label for model training, many scholars have applied transfer learning by pre-training a model on a larger dataset and then fine-tuning it on the target dataset to obtain better classification results. However, such approach, relying on individual expertise to select related datasets, is subjective and inconsistent in performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method for measuring the transferability between different datasets, and build a Dataset Map (DataMap) that can be used as a tool to find the most relevant datasets for transfer learning on target dataset. Recent studies show that the convolutional kernels in CNN models have different function roles. Therefore, we adopt the similarity between the convolution kernels to measure the transferability between datasets. Firstly, the gradient attribution is adopted to attribute the task related convolution kernels from last few convolution layers of the same pre-trained model architecture trained with different datasets. Then, the similarity between attributed convolutional kernels is calculated to denote the transferability between different datasets. Finally, we build a DataMap with 20 medical image datasets. Extensive experimental tests on 3 mainstream CNN architectures show that the proposed method can effectively measure the transferability between different datasets. With the guidance of the DataMap, the transfer learning can achieve the best performance on various training tasks, and the accuracy of the CNN classifier can be improved by 1% to 5% through pre-training.}

In this paper, we use the DempsterâShafer framework to model data uncertainty and propose a hierarchical interval estimation method to improve decision tree algorithms. The proposed method constructs intervals through two methods of attribute boundary and mean square error estimation, which not only utilizes the characteristics of intervals to model the inaccuracy of data, but also constrains intervals from two aspects, narrowing the representation range of available information.

Nevertheless, the substantial consumption of time, storage, and energy substantially limits its deployment on edge devices with constrained resources. Extremely low bit quantization has received wide attention due to its extremely high compression ratio, but the problem of a significant drop in accuracy cannot be ignored. To alleviate the obvious accuracy degradation for extreme low-bit quantization, this paper proposes a novel compression framework for binary and ternary neural networks applied to point clouds, which introduces information geometry to model quantization to compensate the severe feature manifold distortion. It applies differential geometry on manifolds to study the implicit information of the point cloud feature data. Based on the theoretical analysis from the novel perspective of information geometry, two optimization modules are proposed to alleviate severe geometry distortions on differential manifolds. The first module, scaling recovery, provides layer-wise scaling parameters to reduce geometric distortion caused by quantization. The second module, Pooling Recovery, is specially designed to alleviate more severe pooling geometry distortions in point clouds. These two modules benefit both binary and ternary neural networks with ignored overheads. For ternary quantization, optimizations on convolution weights and gradients are additionally introduced. The proposed self-adaptive gradient estimation provides a more accurate approximation to the non-differential ternary staircase function. Convolution weight optimization is implemented on an information-geometry optimized model to achieve even higher accuracy and less memory consumption. Experimental results validate that the proposed models significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods and demonstrate better scalability. Overall, this compression framework has the potential to facilitate the deployment of deep learning models on edge devices with limited resources, opening up new opportunities for applications of three-dimensional computer vision.}

abstract = {Anomaly detection aims at finding anomalies deviating from the normal data patterns. Virtually all anomaly detection methods create a model of the normal patterns before finding anomalies. In high-dimensional scenarios, due to the curse of dimensionality, it is difficult to construct the model of normal patterns in the full dimensional space. Subspace methods assuming that data can be characterized by low-dimensional manifolds have attracted a great deal of research. However, in unsupervised setting, unlabeled data is composed of both the normal and the abnormal data. The existence of anomalies might affect the establishment of the underlying normal subspaces. The undetermined number of the underlying subspaces also brings difficulties in subspace selection. To tackle the aforementioned problems, we come up with a weighted subspace anomaly detection (WSAD) method. We utilize correntropy to construct an objective function to mitigate the influence of the anomalies, which can be regarded as a weighting method for different data. Besides, we introduce an auxiliary variable with block sparsity regularization to achieve adaptive subspace selection, which can be regarded as a weighting method for different subspaces. After the normal underlying subspaces being established, we define the outlier scores by considering the deviation from the underlying subspaces, the local outlier score within subspaces, and the subspace scale. We use the half-quadratic theory to transform the optimization problem defined in WSAD, and apply alternating optimization to solve the transformed problem. Theoretically, we prove the convergence of the optimization algorithm. Experimentally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on both synthetic data and real datasets.}

abstract = {Object detection is a pivotal task in low-altitude UAV application. Here the small scale objects are dominant due to shooting distance and angle and insufficient feature information due to the data from real world scenes. Although general detector has made great progress, it is not suitable for small scale object detection directly. Dense detector has potential because of the pixel-by-pixel detection but the resolving power of complex background and objects especially small scale objects is still insufficient. We propose a Feature Guided Enhancement module by designing two non-linear learning operators to guide more discriminative features when training. Further, a Scale-Aware Weighted loss function is proposed to dynamically weight the loss of various scale objects by statistical computing and highlight the contribution of small scale objects. Experimental results show that our method can effectively improve FCOS and ATSS, and our models obtain better performance by 1.5% and 0.6% AP respectively on VisDrone 2018 dataset.}

abstract = {The performance of traditional deep learning models tends to drop dramatically during being deployed in real-world scenarios when the distribution shift between the seen training and unseen test data occurs. Domain Generalization methods are designed to achieve generalizability to deal with the above issue. Since the features extracted by softmax cross-entropy loss are not adequately domain-invariant, previous works in Domain Generalization have attempted to overcome this problem by employing contrastive-based losses which pull positive pairs (i.e., samples with the same class label) from different domains closer. Unfortunately, these approaches tend to produce an extremely small feature space, which is not robust facing unseen domain and easily overfits to source domains. To address the aforementioned issue, we propose a novel loss named IAIE Loss to simultaneously perform Inter-domain Alignment and Intra-domain Expansion for positive pairs, which facilitates the model to extract domain-invariant features and mitigates overfitting. Specifically, we design two sets of positive samples named âeasy positive samplesâ and âhard positive samplesâ. IAIE Loss pulls the hard positive pairs closer (alignment) while pushing the easy positive pairs apart (expansion). The state-of-the-art results on multiple DG benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our method.}

Since the data output format is a stream of addressable events and not a complete image of light intensities, new algorithms are required for known problems in the field of Computer Vision, such as segmentation, VO, SLAM, object, and scene recognition. There are some proposed methodologies for object recognition using conventional methods, convolutional neural networks, and third-generation neural networks based on spikes. However, convolutional neural networks and spike neural networks require specific hardware for processing, hard to miniaturize. Also, several traditional Computer Vision operators and feature descriptors have been neglected in the context of event sensors and could contribute to lighter methodologies in object recognition. This paper proposes an algorithm for local binary pattern extraction in sparse structures, typically found in this context. This paper also proposes two methodologies using local binary patterns to captures with event-based sensors for object recognition. The first methodology exploits the known motion performed by the sensor, while the second is motion agnostic. It is demonstrated experimentally that the LBP operator is a fast and light alternative that enables variable reduction using PCA in some cases. The experiments also show that it is possible to reduce the final feature vector for classification by up to 99,73% when compared to conventional methods considered state-of-the-art while maintaining comparable accuracy.}

Deep learning has achieved impressive results in localization, but its robustness in dynamic environments has not been adequately addressed.

Specifically, we propose a novel Transformer Bottleneck (TBo) block including convolution, channel attention, and a position-aware self-attention mechanism, which extracts more geometrically robust features by capturing the corresponding long-term dependencies between pixels. Furthermore, we introduce shuffle attention (SA) before the pose regressor, which integrates feature information in both spatial and channel dimensions, forcing the network to learn geometrically robust features, reducing the effects of dynamic objects and illumination conditions to improve camera localization accuracy. We evaluate our method on commonly benchmarked indoor and outdoor datasets and the experimental results show that our proposed method can significantly improve localization performance compared compare favorably to contemporary pose regressors schemes. In addition, extensive ablation evaluations are conducted to prove the effectiveness of our proposed hybrid attention bottleneck block for pose regression networks.}

Despite the remarkable success of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in re-ID, they still face challenges in handling variations in pose, occlusion, and lighting conditions. To effectively tackle these challenges, it is imperative to prioritize implementing efficient sampling strategies. We propose a Novel Attention-Driven Framework for Unsupervised Pedestrian re-ID with Clustering Optimization (AFC) to address the above issues. First, we introduce a new attention mechanism that enhances multi-scale spatial attention and reduces the number of trainable parameters. Then, we employed a straightforward and effective method of group sampling.

To address this issue, we propose the Latent Categories based long-tail Recognition (LCReg) method. Our hypothesis is that common latent features shared by head and tail classes can be used to improve feature representation. Specifically, we learn a set of class-agnostic latent features shared by both head and tail classes, and then use semantic data augmentation on the latent features to implicitly increase the diversity of the training sample. We conduct extensive experiments on five long-tailed image recognition datasets, and the results show that our proposed method significantly improves the baselines.}

We stack these RCR modules to form an RCRNet based on anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) images for cataract recognition. Experiments on the AS-OCT-NC2 dataset and two publicly available medical datasets demonstrate that RCRNet achieves a better trade-off between performance and efficiency than state-of-the-art channel attention-based networks. We also explain the inherent behavior of RCRNet with the aid of the visual analysis. In addition, this paper is the first to study the effects of two performance evaluation methods on AS-OCT image-based cataract classification results: the single-image level and the single-eye level, suggesting that adopting the single-eye level to evaluate cataract classification performance according to clinical diagnosis requirement.}

Understanding a food image at the instance level, including recognition, counting and segmentation, is essential to quantifying nutrition and calorie consumption. Nevertheless, existing techniques are limited to either category-specific instance detection, which does not reflect precisely the instance size at the pixel level, or category-agnostic instance segmentation, which is insufficient for dish recognition. This paper presents a compact and fast multi-task network, namely FoodMask, for clustering-based food instance counting, segmentation and recognition. The network learns a semantic space simultaneously encoding food category distribution and instance height at pixel basis. While the former value addresses instance recognition, the latter value provides prior knowledge for instance extraction. Besides, we integrate into the semantic space a pathway for class-specific counting. With these three outputs, we propose a clustering algorithm to segment and recognize food instances at a real-time speed. Empirical studies are made on three large-scale food datasets, including Mixed Dishes, UECFoodPixComp and FoodSeg103, which cover Western, Chinese, Japanese and Indian cuisines. The proposed networks outperform benchmarks in both terms of instance map quality and speed efficiency.}

The first-order optimality conditions for the non-convex and non-smooth LR-SVM are developed by the newly developed P-stationary point, based on which, the LR support vectors and working set of LR-SVM are defined, interestingly, which shows that all of the LR support vectors are on the two support hyperplanes under mild conditions. A fast proximal alternating direction method of multipliers with working set (LR-ADMM) is developed to handle LR-SVM and LR-ADMM has been demonstrated to achieve global convergence while maintaining a significantly low computational complexity. Numerical comparisons with nine leading solvers show that LR-ADMM demonstrates outstanding performance, particularly when applied to large-scale pattern classification problems with fewer support vectors, higher prediction accuracy and shorter computational time.}

However, in many real-world applications such as autonomous driving vehicles, the risk associated with incorrect predictions of objects or segmentation of images is very high. Standard deep learning models for object detection and segmentation such as YOLO models are often overconfident in their predictions and do not take into account the uncertainty in predictions on out-of-distribution data. In this work, we propose an efficient and effective approach, Monte-Carlo DropBlock (MC-DropBlock), to model uncertainty in YOLO and convolutional vision Transformers for object detection. The proposed approach applies drop-block during training time and testing time on the convolutional layer of the deep learning models such as YOLO and convolutional transformer. We theoretically show that this leads to a Bayesian convolutional neural network capable of capturing the epistemic uncertainty in the model. Additionally, we capture the aleatoric uncertainty in the data using a Gaussian likelihood. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on modeling uncertainty in object detection and segmentation tasks using out-of-distribution experiments. Experimental results show that MC-DropBlock improves the generalization, calibration, and uncertainty modeling capabilities of YOLO models and convolutional Transformer models for object detection and segmentation.}

A paradigmatic example is computational pathology, where the lack of patch-level labels for whole-slide images prevents the application of supervised models. Probabilistic MIL methods based on Gaussian Processes (GPs) have obtained promising results due to their excellent uncertainty estimation capabilities. However, these are general-purpose MIL methods that do not take into account one important fact: in (histopathological) images, the labels of neighboring patches are expected to be correlated. In this work, we extend a state-of-the-art GP-based MIL method, which is called VGPMIL-PR, to exploit such correlation. To do so, we develop a novel coupling term inspired by the statistical physics Ising model. We use variational inference to estimate all the model parameters. Interestingly, the VGPMIL-PR formulation is recovered when the weight that regulates the strength of the Ising term vanishes. The performance of the proposed method is assessed in two real-world problems of prostate cancer detection. We show that our model achieves better results than other state-of-the-art probabilistic MIL methods. We also provide different visualizations and analysis to gain insights into the influence of the novel Ising term. These insights are expected to facilitate the application of the proposed model to other research areas.}

abstract = {With the emerging of new data collection ways, the features are incremental and accumulated gradually. Due to the expansion of feature spaces, it is more common that there are unknown biases between the distribution of training and testing datasets. It is known as the unknown data selection bias, which belongs to the learning scenario with non-i.i.d samples. The performance of traditional approaches, which need the i.i.d. assumption, will be aggravated seriously. How to design an algorithm to address the problem of data selection bias in this feature incremental scenario is crucial but rarely studied. In this paper, we propose a feature incremental classification algorithm with causality. Firstly, we embed the confounding variable balance algorithm in causal learning into the prediction modeling and utilize the logical regression algorithm with balancing regular terms as a baseline. Then, to satisfy the special requirement of feature increment, we design a new regularizer, which maintains the consistency of the regression coefficients between the data in the current and previous stages. It retains the correlation between the old features and labels. Finally, we propose the Multiple Balancing Logistic Regression model (MBRLR) to jointly optimize the balancing regularizer and weighted logistic regression model with multiple feature sets. We also present theoretical results to show that our proposed algorithm can make precise and stable predictions. Besides, the numerical results also demonstrate that our MBRLR algorithm is superior to other methods.}

In order to take full use of the restricted parameters caused by the lightweight structure to enhance the accuracy under the premise of guaranteeing high speed, a multi-feature cross-channel information sharing mechanism is proposed. Dynamic nonlinear composite mapping between feature channels uses cross-channel residual blocks to share data information and establish coupling relationships.

Instead of simply incorporating a classifier to infer the class labels of unlabeled data, the key idea behind SAFT-GAN is to incorporate class-semantic guidance in real-fake discrimination. More specifically, we adopt a two-head architecture for a discriminator: A label-embedded head identifies real and fake instances, conditioned on class label. To focus more on class-related regions, we exploit class-aware attention information to regularize this head via regional feature transforms. On the other hand, to make better use of unlabeled data, we design a label-free head, on which channel-adaptive feature transforms are imposed to fuse the discriminator and classifier features, such that the class semantics of synthesized images can be improved. Extensive experiments are performed to demonstrate how class-conditional image synthesis can benefit from the proposed feature transforms, and also demonstrate the superiority of SAFT-GAN.}

abstract = {Deep learning techniques have made significant advancements in reference-based colorization by training on large-scale datasets. However, directly applying these methods to the task of colorizing old photos is challenging due to the lack of ground truth and the notorious domain gap between natural gray images and old photos. To address this issue, we propose a novel CNN-based algorithm called SFAC, i.e., Structure-preserving Feature Alignment Colorizer. SFAC is trained on only two images for old photo colorization, eliminating the reliance on big data and allowing direct processing of the old photo itself to overcome the domain gap problem. Our primary objective is to establish semantic correspondence between the two images, ensuring that semantically related objects have similar colors. We achieve this through a feature distribution alignment loss that remains robust to different metric choices. However, utilizing robust semantic correspondence to transfer color from the reference to the old photo can result in inevitable structure distortions. To mitigate this, we introduce a structure-preserving mechanism that incorporates a perceptual constraint at the feature level and a frozen-updated pyramid at the pixel level. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for old photo colorization, as confirmed by qualitative and quantitative metrics.}

abstract = {The existing graph-based dimensionality reduction algorithms need to learn an adjacency matrix or construct it in advance, therefore the time complexity of the graph-based dimensionality reduction algorithms is not less than O(n2d), where n denotes the number of samples, d denotes the number of dimensions. Moreover, the existing dimensionality reduction algorithms do not consider the cluster information in the original space, resulting in the weakening or even loss of valuable information after dimensionality reduction. To address the above problems, we propose Fast Anchor Graph Preserving Projections (FAGPP), which learns the projection matrix, the anchors and the membership matrix at the same time. Especially, FAGPP has a built-in Principal Component Analysis (PCA) item, which makes our model not only deal with the cluster information of data, but also deal with the global information of data. The time complexity of FAGPP is O(nmd), where m denotes the number of the anchors and m is much less than n. We propose a novel iterative algorithm to solve the proposed model and the convergence of the algorithm is proved theoretically. The experimental results on a large number of high-dimensional benchmark image data sets demonstrate the efficiency of FAGPP. The data sets and the source code are available from https://github.com/511lab/FAGPP.}

abstract = {Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a classic weakly supervised learning approach, in which samples are grouped into bags that may contain varying numbers of instances. A bag is designated as positive if it contains at least one positive instance; otherwise, it is considered negative. Previous studies have consistently assumed that the bag labels are completely known. In fact, labeling every bag can be extremely challenging or even unfeasible due to the exorbitant expenses in terms of time and labor. Fortunately, it is much easier to obtain the similarity confidence, which represents the probability of two bags sharing the same label. How to employ it in MIL is worthy of study. Inspired by the above study, we present the first attempt to investigate MIL from similarity-confidence bags. Therefore, this paper proposes a new framework for training bag-level classifiers that adheres to the principle of empirical risk minimization. Moreover, we theoretically derive a generalization error bound to guarantee model convergence. Finally, we implement risk correction to mitigate potential over-fitting problem and provide theoretical consistency. Numerical experiments on eight datasets further validate the effectiveness of the proposed bag-level classifier.}

Some methods leverage trace ratio criterion and attain clusters by borrowing the K-means algorithm. However, trace ratio criterion has no close-formed solution for the discriminative projection matrix and the K-means algorithm has a limited capacity to handle the many-cluster problem. In this paper, Coordinate Descent Optimized Trace Difference model (CDOTD) is proposed for joint clustering and feature extraction. Formulating the objective function as a direct trace difference criterion containing a balance parameter, CDOTD harmonizes between-cluster scatter maximization and within-cluster scatter minimization by the balance parameter. Using the direct trace difference criterion, CDOTD can straightforward solve for the discriminative projection matrix and avoid obtaining a poor discriminative projection matrix in the iterative manner when a bad cluster start is given. CDOTD uses the coordinate descent method for clustering optimization, improving the ability to address the many-cluster problem. Extensive experiments show that CDOTD has achieved significant performance improvements compared to previous trace ratio criterion related joint clustering and feature extraction methods, and also outperformed other clustering methods in most cases.}

However, most existing robustness evaluations in NAS only consider lâ norm-based adversarial noises. In order to improve the robustness of DNN models against multiple types of noises, it is necessary to consider a comprehensive evaluation in NAS for robust architectures. But with the increasing number of types of robustness evaluations, it also becomes more time-consuming to find comprehensively robust architectures. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel efficient search of comprehensively robust neural architectures via multi-fidelity evaluation (ES-CRNA-ME). Specifically, we first search for comprehensively robust architectures under multiple types of evaluations using the weight-sharing-based NAS method, including different lp norm attacks, semantic adversarial attacks, and composite adversarial attacks. In addition, we reduce the number of robustness evaluations by the correlation analysis, which can incorporate similar evaluations and decrease the evaluation cost. Finally, we propose a multi-fidelity online surrogate during optimization to further decrease the search cost. On the basis of the surrogate constructed by low-fidelity data, the online high-fidelity data is utilized to finetune the surrogate. Experiments on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed method.}

In this paper, we propose a novel coupled discriminative manifold alignment (CDMA) method for LR face recognition. Specifically, in the training stage the principal component analysis (PCA) is first used to reduce the dimensional gap between LR and HR facial features. Next the LR face images and the corresponding HR face images are converted into a common shared feature subspace by learning two linear mappings in a supervised manner, where the neighborhood samples within the same class and from different classes are jointly exploited to align the manifold structures of LR and HR faces. In the test stage, for a given LR face in the probe set, two learned coupled mappings (CMs) are applied to match the HR images in the gallery set through the correlative metric. Thorough experimental results on three representative face databases verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparing with other state-of-the-art competitors. In particular, the proposed method is capable of yielding more competitive recognition performance than other predecessors when lower dimensional feature subspaces are applied to match the expected HR faces.}

In recent years, deep learning-based methods have achieved success. However, existing image dehazing methods typically neglect the hierarchy of features in the neural network and fail to exploit their relationships fully. To this end, we propose an effective image dehazing method named Hierarchical Contrastive Dehazing (HCD), which is based on feature fusion and contrastive learning strategies. HCD consists of a hierarchical dehazing network (HDN) and a novel hierarchical contrastive loss (HCL). Specifically, the core design in the HDN is a hierarchical interaction module, which utilizes multi-scale activation to revise the feature responses hierarchically. To cooperate with the training of HDN, we propose HCL which performs contrastive learning on hierarchically paired exemplars, facilitating haze removal. Extensive experiments on public datasets, RESIDE, HazeRD, and DENSE-HAZE, demonstrate that HCD quantitatively outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM and achieves better visual quality.}

However, previous methods do not fully use spatialâtemporal context and fail to tackle this challenging task in real-time. This motivates us to develop an efficient Long-Short Temporal Attention network (termed LSTA) for unsupervised VOS task from a holistic view. Specifically, LSTA consists of two dominant modules, i.e., Long Temporal Memory and Short Temporal Attention. The former captures the long-term global pixel relations of the past frames and the current frame, which models constantly present objects by encoding appearance pattern. Meanwhile, the latter reveals the short-term local pixel relations of one nearby frame and the current frame, which models moving objects by encoding motion pattern. To speedup the inference, the efficient projection and the locality-based sliding window are adopted to achieve nearly linear time complexity for the two light modules, respectively.

The use of dataset-level regression on synthesized meta-datasets (comprised of many sample sets) has shown promising results for ACAEval. However, the existing meta-dataset for ACAEval is created using simple image transformations such as rotation and background substitution, which can make it difficult to ensure a reasonable distribution shift between the sample set and the test set. When the distribution shift is large, it becomes challenging to estimate the classifier accuracy on the test set using those sample sets. To ensure more robust ACAEval, this paper attempts to customize a meta-dataset in which each sample set has a reasonable distribution shift to the test set. An intra-class cycle-consistent adversarial learning (ICAL) method is introduced to transfer the style of a labeled training set to the style of the test set, by jointly considering the domain shift issue, the label flipping issue (the semantic information may be changed after style transformation), and the diversity of multiple sample sets in the meta-dataset. Experiments validate that under the same experimental setup, our method outperforms the existing ACAEval methods by a good margin, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on several standard benchmark datasets, including digit classification and natural image classification.}

In this paper, a deep neural network that combines a set of convolutional layers and capsule network is proposed. The proposed architecture named DCapsNet is suited to automatically extract the activity or gait features through built in sensors and classify them. The convolutional layers of the DCapsNet are more suitable for processing temporal sequences and provide scalar outputs but not the equivariance. The capsule network (CapsNet) is then trained by a dynamic routing algorithm to capture the equivariance having a magnitude and orientation, which increases the efficiency of the model classification. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated on four public datasets: two HAR datasets (UCI-HAR and WISDM) and two gait datasets (WhuGAIT). The recognition accuracy of the proposed model for the UCI-HAR and WISDM datasets are 97.92Â % and 99.30Â %, respectively, and for the WhuGAIT Dataset #1 and Dataset #2 are 94.75Â % and 97.16Â %, respectively.

To address this, we exploit synthetic data, which provides precise eye landmark labels, by jointly training an eye landmark detector using labeled synthetic data and unlabeled real-world data in a semi-supervised manner. To reduce the influence of discrepancy between synthetic and real-world data, we improve the generalization ability of the landmark detector by performing a self-supervised learning strategy on a large scale of unlabeled real-world images.

abstract = {Online hashing technology has attracted extensive attention owing to its effectiveness and efficiency in processing large-scale streaming data. However, there are still some limitations: (1) In practical applications, the observed labels of multimedia data are obtained through manual annotation, which may inevitably introduce some noises into labels. This may lead to retrieval performance degradation when the noisy labels are directly applied to retrieval tasks. (2) The potential semantic correlation of multi-labels cannot be fully explored. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we propose robust online hashing with label semantic enhancement (ROHLSE). Specifically, ROHLSE seeks to recover the clean labels from the provided noisy labels by imposing low-rank and sparse constraints. Meanwhile, it employs the representation of samples in the feature space to predict the labels via the dependency between sample instances and labels. To efficiently handle streaming data, ROHLSE preserves the similarity between new data, and establishes the semantic relationships between new and old data through chunk similarity, simultaneously. Furthermore, ROHLSE can fully utilize the semantic correlations between multiple labels of each instance. Extensive experiments are conducted on three benchmark datasets to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed ROHLSE approach.}

On the basis of the observation that individual body size is highly correlated with the amplitude component of the motion sequence, we disentangle the individuality and action features by using contrastive self-supervised learning with data augmentation that randomizes only the phase component of the motion sequence. This enables us to estimate the subject label of each motion sequence and to train a subject-agnostic action recognition classifier by performing adversarial learning with the estimated subject labels. We empirically demonstrate the superiority of our method on two different action recognition tasks (skeleton-based action recognition and sensor-based activity recognition).}

To address these issues, we propose a novel prediction framework, dubbed Mixing Feature Attention Network (MFAN). Specifically, the proposed mixing feature attention is a parallel design to adaptively determine the importance of different interacted features and simultaneously capture the global interaction feature to improve interaction modeling. Meanwhile, the spatial global interaction is modeled from a spatial edge-featured graph input to capture the enhanced spatial interaction. The temporal motion pattern is modeled from a temporal edge-featured graph input to enhance the domain adaption.

Due to the fundamental architectural differences between CNNs, which still dominate the image recognition applications, and transformers, the state-of-the-art attacks designed for CNNs are not effective against transformers, and vice versa. Such lack of transferability in attacks and the growing architectural heterogeneity in practice make the black-box attack design increasingly challenging. However, skillful attackers can handle the increasing uncertainty in target model architecture following two main approaches: designing transferable attacks that are robust to the architectural uncertainty in target model, and identifying the target architecture for attack selection. In this work, following the latter approach we propose a novel architecture-agnostic black-box attack design and analyze its performance. Experiments show that the proposed method, with a reasonable query overhead, outperforms the recent robust attack designs that follow the former approach. Different from the existing methods, the proposed method optimizes a trade-off between prior information about the target model and number of queries.}

To tackle this challenge, we design a simple yet effective adversarial contrastive feature learning (ACFL) framework, which enhances the discriminative capability of features by introducing more transformed hard samples in the feature learning process. Specifically, it mainly consists of a discriminative feature learning module and a hard sample generation module. The discriminative feature learning module extracts recognizable features of unlabeled training samples to estimate the high-confidence relationship between samples. Then, the hard sample generation module utilizes these high-confidence relationships between samples to transfer all samples into the hard ones via an adversarial learning strategy. Finally, the generated hard samples are further fed into DFL to learn discriminative features for person Re-ID.

Current methods primarily extract salient object information in the pixel perspective. However, biological and psychological research indicates notable frequency sensitivity of the human visual system (HVS). The high-frequency (HF) and low-frequency (LF) information in images are processed by different neural channels, which has been overlooked in SOD. In this study, we argue that the objective of RGB-T SOD is not only to enhance feature representation in the pixel-aware but also to emulate human visual mechanisms. To our best knowledge, we explore RGB-T SOD from the frequency perspective for the first time. Specifically, we first present a frequency-aware multi-spectral feature aggregation module (FMFA) to exploit the separability and complementarity of frequency-aware features, generating and making full use of LF and HF cues. FMFA improves the feature representation of RGB-T from the frequency perspective and provides stronger frequency cues for boundary auxiliary tasks. Then, we develop an HF-guided signed distance map prediction module (HF-SDM) with dual-task consistency to effectively alleviate the coarse mask caused by blur boundary. HF-SDM employs the geometric relationship of objects which boosts the interaction between salient regions and boundaries. As a result, the model can gain sharper boundaries for salient objects. Finally, we propose a frequency-aware feature aggregation network (FFANet) incorporated with dual-task learning. Extensive experiments on RGB-T SOD datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

In addition, SSL-Net also includes a channel-spatial attention feature gathering block, which gathers features along the spatial direction and channel dimension of correspondences. To mitigate the existence of label ambiguity, we incorporate the accommodation factor into the loss function of SSL-Net for feature matching. As a result, our network outperforms the state-of-the-art method by a considerable margin. Notably, SSL-Net achieves a 9.05% improvement under an error threshold of 5Â° over the state-of-the-art method for the relative pose estimation task on the YFCC100M dataset.

However, previous studies have primarily focused on developing intricate network architecture designs, neglecting the impact of source data quality and the challenges posed by the out-of-distribution target data problem. To address these limitations, we argue that a target data-centered space, augmented by a carefully selected set of high-quality source data, can significantly enhance DA. In this study, we present an unsupervised end-to-end subject adaptation approach called GITGAN, a generative inter-subject transfer for electroencephalography motor imagery analysis. We also propose a practical and effective method for selecting source data, which further enhances performance. Our approach is non-intrusive, as it does not modify the target data distribution, thus preserving its integrity for further numerical and visual analysis. Our extensive experiments with two different datasets demonstrate not only the superiority of our approach compared to existing methods, but also its phenomenal potential for practical BCI applications. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the potential of BCI and illustrate the importance of considering source data quality in DA.

With the widely used spatio-temporal neural networks, researchers have found that the learned high-level features preserve overfitted spatial information and limited temporal information, leading to inferior performance. This is because existing networks lack efficient regularization for the temporal structure. To learn more robust temporal features, we propose a temporal regularization method named Temporal Segment Dropout (TSD). TSD drops the most salient spatial features in order to enhance the temporal features in a clip of temporal segments. Without learning from complex examples, TSD can be easily deployed in existing networks. In the experiment, TSD is extensively evaluated on benchmark action recognition datasets, which brings consistent improvements over the baselines, especially for the action-centric classes.}

In this paper, we propose an uncertainty analysis evidence model and design a distribution driven active transfer learning (DATL) algorithm. DATL realizes fine-grained recognition of unknown categories with no requirements on the source domain to contain the unknown categories. To explore unknown distributions, the uncertainty analysis evidence model was adopted to divide the high uncertainty space. To select critical instances, a cluster-diversity query strategy was proposed to identify new categories. To enrich the label categories of the source domain, a global dynamic alignment strategy was designed to avoid negative transfers. Comparative experiments with state-of-the-art methods on the standard Office-31/Office-Home/Office-Caltech10 benchmarks showed that the DATL algorithm: (1) outperformed its competitors; (2) realized accurate identification of unknown subcategories from a fine-grained perspective; and (3) achieved outstanding performance even with a very high degree of openness.}

Despite the growing number of fairness studies in FR, the fairness of face presentation attack detection (PAD) has been overlooked, mainly due to the lack of appropriately annotated data. To avoid and mitigate the potential negative impact of such behavior, it is essential to assess the fairness in face PAD and develop fair PAD models. To enable fairness analysis in face PAD, we present a Combined Attribute Annotated PAD Dataset (CAAD-PAD), offering seven human-annotated attribute labels. Then, we comprehensively analyze the fairness of PAD and its relation to the nature of the training data and the Operational Decision Threshold Assignment (ODTA) through a set of face PAD solutions. Additionally, we propose a novel metric, the Accuracy Balanced Fairness (ABF), that jointly represents both the PAD fairness and the absolute PAD performance. The experimental results pointed out that female and faces with occluding features (e.g. eyeglasses, beard, etc.) are relatively less protected than male and non-occlusion groups by all PAD solutions. To alleviate this observed unfairness, we propose a plug-and-play data augmentation method, FairSWAP, to disrupt the identity/semantic information and encourage models to mine the attack clues. The extensive experimental results indicate that FairSWAP leads to better-performing and fairer face PADs in 10 out of 12 investigated cases.}

Therefore, this paper proposes a uniform representation model for simultaneous PAD and subsurface fingerprint reconstruction. A novel semantic segmentation network using attention mechanisms was designed to extract and segment multiple subsurface structures from real finger slices (i.e., B-scans). The latent codes derived from the network are directly used to effectively detect PA because they contain abundant subsurface biological information, which is independent of PA materials and has strong robustness for unknown PAs. Segmented subsurface structures were adopted to reconstruct multiple subsurface 2D fingerprints. Extensive experiments were carried out on an in-house database, which is the largest public OCT-based fingerprint database with 2449 volumes. PAD performance was evaluated by comparing the results of the existing methods with those of other segmentation networks. The proposed uniform representation model can obtain an accuracy (Acc) of 96.63%, which achieves a state-of-the-art performance. The effectiveness of subsurface reconstruction was evaluated from the segmentation and recognition results. In the segmentation experiments, the proposed method achieved the best results with an Intersection of Union (mIOU) of 0.834 and a Pixel Accuracy of 0.937. By comparing the recognition performance on surface 2D fingerprints (e.g., commercial and high-resolution), the lowest results with an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 2.25% by minutiae matching and an EER of 5.42% by pore matching are achieved, which indicates the excellent reconstruction capability of the proposed uniform representation model.}

Despite the satisfactory performance, existing approaches are reliant on the closed-world assumption. When confronted with real-world retrieval tasks involving out-of-distribution (OOD) semantic data, the similarity relationships of known data retained in hash codes tend to be disrupted by these unknown ones, resulting in retrieval performance degradation. To this end, we present a deep self-enhancing hashing (DSEH) method, simultaneously learning multi-level similarity-preserved hash codes of the known multi-label cross-modal data and robustness to OOD instances. Specifically, we propose to construct pseudo-OOD samples in the feature space using random linear combinations to explore OOD semantics, during the training process. Meanwhile, a prototype-based generative model is incorporated to aggregate batch data to enhance the data representationâs differences in known and unknown semantics. Furthermore, we describe a bounded cosine quadrupled loss with distance bound to preserve the multi-level similarity of multi-label data and control the maximum distance between known data and the minimum distance between known and pseudo-OOD data for learning OOD robustness. Extensive experiments show that the DSEH achieves state-of-the-art performance on closed-world tasks and good performance on simulated real-world tasks.}

In this paper, to resolve the first issue, we propose a hard positives oriented contrastive (HPC) learning strategy to pre-train an encoder-decoder-based segmentation model. Different from vanilla contrastive learning tending to focus only on hard negatives, our HPC learning strategy additionally concentrates on hard positives (i.e., samples with the same category but dissimilar feature representations to the anchor), which are considered to play an even more crucial role in delivering discriminative knowledge for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Specifically, the HPC is constructed from two levels, including an unsupervised image-level HPC (IHPC) and a supervised pixel-level HPC (PHPC), empowering the embedding space learned by the encoder with both local and global senses. Particularly, the PHPC learning strategy is implemented in a region-based manner, saving memory usage while delivering more multi-granularity information. In response to the second issue, we insert several feature swap (FS) modules into the pre-trained decoder. These FS modules aim to perturb the mapping from the intermediate embedding space towards the pixel space, trying to encourage more robust segmentation predictions. Experiments on two public clinical datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework surpasses the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

ILP aims to relax the constraints of labeled samples and group a set of unlabeled pedestrians by their potential identities. The main idea is that the category relationships between pedestrians (nodes) can be inferred from their local context in the feature space. Specifically, an Identity Link Subgraph (ILS) describes the link relationship between nodes and their nearest neighbors, which is constructed by a two-step procedure. Meanwhile, a Dynamic Penalty Module (DPM) is introduced at each ILS construction step to infer which linkage between pairs in the ILS should be pruned to assign higher-quality classification labels. To fully use the accurate identity information in initial labeled samples, we jointly use identity pseudo-labels (which are estimated by adopting the Nearest Neighbors classifier) with classification pseudo-labels for model training. Moreover, we design a Dual-Branch Fusion network (DBF-Net) to optimize the CNN model simultaneously through all (pseudo-)labeled samples. Results on multiple datasets prove that DBF-Net outperforms traditional one-shot Re-ID methods by a large margin.}

abstract = {Although k-means and its variants are known for their remarkable efficiency, they suffer from a strong dependence on the prior knowledge of K and the assumption of a circle-like pattern, which can result in the algorithms dividing the input space instead of discovering non-predetermined data patterns. Thus, we propose beyond k-means++ that infers and utilizes explicit clusters by emphasizing local geometrical information for better cluster exploration. To avoid the K dependence, a novel framework of iterative division and aggregation (IDA) over k-means++ is presented. It begins with any Kâ¥1, then increases and reduces K along with the procedure of clustersâ division and aggregation, respectively. To break through the circle-like pattern limitation, we introduce a reasonability checking strategy (RCS) for cluster division. Given local geometrical information, RCS achieves arbitrary cluster shape support by rejecting edge patterns with distinguished convergence direction and merging adjacent clusters with pseudo-edge patterns. Furthermore, we design an edge shrinkage strategy (ESS). Taking edge patterns as the cluster prototype, it benefits accuracy by effectively avoiding representability reduction due to irregular distribution. To compensate for the loss of efficiency, a near maximin and random sampling algorithm is suggested for large-scale data with high dimensionality. Experimental results confirm that beyond k-means++ is featured by handling arbitrary cluster shapes with remarkable accuracy.}

Due to the extremely imbalanced data distribution in long-tailed learning, the learning process shows great uncertainties. For example, the predictions of different experts on the same image vary remarkably despite the same training settings. To alleviate the uncertainty, we propose a Nested Collaborative Learning (NCL++) which tackles the long-tailed learning problem by a collaborative learning. To be specific, the collaborative learning consists of two folds, namely inter-expert collaborative learning (InterCL) and intra-expert collaborative learning (IntraCL). InterCL learns multiple experts collaboratively and concurrently, aiming to transfer the knowledge among different experts. IntraCL is similar to InterCL, but it aims to conduct the collaborative learning on multiple augmented copies of the same image within the single expert. To achieve the collaborative learning in long-tailed learning, the balanced online distillation is proposed to force the consistent predictions among different experts and augmented copies, which reduces the learning uncertainties. Moreover, in order to improve the meticulous distinguishing ability on the confusing categories, we further propose a Hard Category Mining (HCM), which selects the negative categories with high predicted scores as the hard categories. Then, the collaborative learning is formulated in a nested way, in which the learning is conducted on not just all categories from a full perspective but some hard categories from a partial perspective. Extensive experiments manifest the superiority of our method with outperforming the state-of-the-art whether with using a single model or an ensemble. The code will be publicly released.}

Based on this, we propose a novel simple encoderâdecoder architecture that aims to reduce the SOTA model parameters and complexity while keeping the depth estimation accuracy as high as possible rather than aiming for extremely lightweight. Meanwhile, in order to further refine the multi-scale information extracted by the encoder, we propose a Multi-dimensional Convolutional Attention (MCA) module. To enhance the extraction of global information for accurate pixel classification, we propose a Dual Attention Transformer (DAT) module to extract global features of images. Furthermore, experimental results on the KITTI and NYU datasets demonstrate that the advantage of our proposed framework is that it achieves almost equivalent depth estimation performance to the current SOTA with fewer parameters and lower complexity. To the best of our knowledge, CATNet is the first work that achieves nearly the same depth estimation accuracy as Transformer-based large model encoders with so few parameters.}

However, since the target class is treated as the background in the training, the network tends to extract much irrelevant nuisance factors, which results in the feature undermining problem for the target class. Consequently, it is difficult to produce an accurate segmentation map. To address this problem, in this paper, we apply the information bottleneck theory to few-shot semantic segmentation and propose the Foreground Information Bottleneck (FIB) module. Based on the support information, FIB module filters out the irrelevant information and promotes the foreground-related feature paradigms. Meanwhile, to solve the intractable mutual information and enable the end-to-end optimization of FIB module, we derive the Foreground Information Bottleneck Loss (FIBLoss) according to the inherent attribute of few-shot segmentation. Moreover, since there exists severe noise interference in the wild, we design a Target Information Refinement (TIR) block to further exploit discriminative cues of foreground. TIR block calculates the pairwise interaction and exploits the detailed information of the foreground object, which is beneficial to the feature refinement. Extensive experiments on two challenging datasets reflect the proposed FIB module significantly improves the performance of few-shot segmentation and delivers the state-of-the-art results.}

It holds noticeable advantage of high dynamic range, high speed response, and low power budget that enable it to best capture local motions in uncontrolled environments. This motivates us to unlock the potential of event cameras for human pose estimation, as the human pose estimation with event cameras is rarely explored. Due to the novel paradigm shift from conventional frame-based cameras, however, event signals in a time interval contain very limited information, as event cameras can only capture the moving body parts and ignores those static body parts, resulting in some parts to be incomplete or even disappeared in the time interval. This paper proposes a novel densely connected recurrent architecture to address the problem of incomplete information. By this recurrent architecture, we can explicitly model not only the sequential but also non-sequential geometric consistency across time steps to accumulate information from previous frames to recover the entire human bodies, achieving a stable and accurate human pose estimation from event data. Moreover, to better evaluate our model, we collect a large-scale multimodal event-based dataset that comes with human pose annotations, which is by far the most challenging one to the best of our knowledge. The experimental results on two public datasets and our own dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and strength of our approach. Code is available online for facilitating the future research.}

Especially in the autonomous driving field, attacking a traffic sign classification network results in a serious consequence. Most existing researches prefer to digital level attacks focusing on smaller or more imperceptible adversarial noise. Given that attacks available to real-world implementation usually emerge in more security-critical scenarios, we propose an adaptively adversarial example generation algorithm for physical attacks in the real-world setting. Taking account of the traffic sign classification, our approach is divided into two steps. The first step is to generate a probability map which precisely predicts the probability of being attacked for each pixel in the input image through the proposed Pinpoint Region Probability Estimation Network (PRPEN) and meanwhile, try to reduce the size of the highlighted area in the map. It can also be regarded as a classification problem in which every pixel has two classes, suitable for attacking or not, including the restrictions on the number of items in the suitable sort. The second one is to remake a mask depending on the probability map and optimize adversarial patches only on what mask decides. Experimental results show that our method achieves almost 100% misclassification rate in several widely used networks with even smaller patches. We also find how to effectively disguise as a target class to mislead the DNN classifiers and improve AI security.}

abstract = {Due to the lack of rotation invariance in traditional convolution operations, even acting a slight rotation on the input can severely degrade the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). To address this, we propose a Rotation-Invariant Coordinate Convolution (RIC-C), which achieves natural invariance to arbitrary rotations around the input center without additional trainable parameters or data augmentation. We first evaluate the rotational invariance of RIC-C using the MNIST dataset and compare its performance with most previous rotation-invariant CNN models. RIC-C achieves state-of-the-art classification on the MNIST-rot test set without data augmentation and with lower computational costs. Then, the interchangeability of RIC-C with traditional convolution operations is demonstrated by seamlessly integrating it into common CNN models like VGG, ResNet, and DenseNet. We conduct remote sensing image classification on the NWPU VHR-10, MTARSI and AID datasets and patch matching experiments on the UBC benchmark dataset, showing that RIC-C significantly enhances the performance of CNN models across different applications, especially when training data is limited.

abstract = {Humanâobject interaction (HOI) detection aims to localize and classify triplets of human, object and interaction from a given image. Earlier two-stage methods suffer both from mutually independent training processes and the interference of redundant negative humanâobject pairs. Prevailing one-stage transformer-based methods are free from the above problems by tackling HOI in an end-to-end manner. However, one-stage transformer-based methods carry the unnecessary entanglements of the query for different tasks, i.e., humanâobject detection and interaction classification, and thus bring in poor performance. In this paper, we propose a new transformer-based approach that parallelly disentangles humanâobject detection and interaction classification in a triplet-wise manner. To make each query focus on one specific task clearly, we exhaustively disentangle HOI by parallelly expanding the naive query in vanilla transformer as triple explicit queries. Then, we introduce a semantic communication layer to preserve the consistent semantic association of each HOI through mixing the feature representations of each query triplet of the correspondence constraint. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms the existing methods and achieves the state-of-the-art performance, with significant reduction in parameters and FLOPs.}

abstract = {Latent Dirichlet allocation model (LDA) has been widely used in topic modeling. Recent works have shown the effectiveness of integrating neural network mechanisms with this generative model for learning text representation. However, one of the significant setbacks of LDA is that it is based on a Dirichlet prior that has a restrictive covariance structure. All its variables are considered to be negatively correlated, which makes the model restrictive. In a practical sense, topics can be positively or negatively correlated. To address this problem, we proposed a generalized Dirichlet variational autoencoder (GD-VAE) for topic modeling. The Generalized Dirichlet (GD) distribution has a more general covariance structure than the Dirichlet distribution because it takes into account both positively and negatively correlated topics in the corpus. Our proposed model leverages rejection sampling variational inference using a reparameterization trick for effective training. GD-VAE compares favorably to recent works on topic models on several benchmark corpora. Experiments show that accounting for topicsâ positive and negative correlations results in better performance. We further validate the superiority of our proposed framework on two image data sets. GD-VAE demonstrates its significance as an integral part of a classification architecture.

In this algorithm, a loss of graph consistency is proposed to reduce the impact of false negative samples by comparing the neighbor distribution of positive samples. Furthermore, an incremental training method is designed to control the quality of the selected positives. Extensive experiments show that our algorithm outperforms other deep clustering methods on wide-used benchmark data sets.}

abstract = {Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) have demonstrated powerful representing ability of irregular data, e.g., skeletal data and graph-structured data, providing the effective mechanism to fuse the neighbor nodes. However, inheriting from the deep learning, GCN also lacks interpretability, which hinders its application to scenarios that have high demand for transparency. Although, there have been many efforts on the interpretability of deep learning, they mainly concentrate on i.i.d data that is hard to be deployed to GCNs, which involve not only the node feature, but also the graph structure. There are few works that attempt to explain it with post-hoc manner, which can be biased, resulting in mis-representation of the true explanation. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a framework, namely ExpFiGCN, that reveals explainability of the GCNs from the perspective of graph structure and mathematical analysis. Specifically, ExpFiGCN can find the most intrinsically relevant node to the central node and obtain the informative and discriminative signals while performing denoising. For the graph structure, we find K-nearest nodes; for the mathematical analysis, every channel of a node and its neighborhoods contribute dynamically to the final channel signal, which can capture the inherent difference of different channels and neighbor nodes. Meanwhile, it can enhance the representation ability of nodes and ameliorate the over-smoothing problem. On the other hand, our model can dynamically adjust the importance of neighborhoods to the central vertex. We empirically validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework ExpFiGCN on various benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that our method achieves substantial improvements and outperforms the state-of-the-art performance strikingly.}

abstract = {Deep clustering has shown its promising capability in joint representation learning and clustering via deep neural networks. Despite the significant progress, the existing deep clustering works mostly utilize some distribution-based clustering loss, lacking the ability to unify representation learning and multi-scale structure learning. To address this, this paper presents a new deep clustering approach termed Image clustering with contrastive learning and multi-scale Graph Convolutional Networks (IcicleGCN), which bridges the gap between convolutional neural network (CNN) and graph convolutional network (GCN) as well as the gap between contrastive learning and multi-scale structure learning for the deep clustering task. Our framework consists of four main modules, namely, the CNN-based backbone, the Instance Similarity Module (ISM), the Joint Cluster Structure Learning and Instance reconstruction Module (JC-SLIM), and the Multi-scale GCN module (M-GCN). Specifically, the backbone network with two weight-sharing views is utilized to learn the representations for the two augmented samples (from each image). The learned representations are then fed to ISM and JC-SLIM for joint instance-level and cluster-level contrastive learning, respectively, during which an auto-encoder in JC-SLIM is also pretrained to serve as a bridge to the M-GCN module. Further, to enforce multi-scale neighborhood structure learning, two streams of GCNs and the auto-encoder are simultaneously trained via (i) the layer-wise interaction with representation fusion and (ii) the joint self-adaptive learning. Experiments on multiple image datasets demonstrate the superior clustering performance of IcicleGCN over the state-of-the-art. The code is available at https://github.com/xuyuankun631/IcicleGCN.}

Current deep learning techniques are mainly based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and their hybrids. However, CNNs focus on spatial and local information, while RNNs are unparallelizable, and they suffer from gradient vanishing/exploding. Their hybrids often face problems of model complexity and high computational cost. Because sEMG signals have a sequential nature, motivated by the sequence modeling network Transformer and its self-attention mechanism, we propose a Transformer-based network, temporal depthwise convolutional Transformer (TDCT), for sparse sEMG recognition. With this network, higher recognition accuracy is achieved with fewer convolution parameters and a lower computational cost. Specifically, this network has parallel capability and can capture long-range features inside sEMG signals. We improve the locality and channel correlation capture of multi-head self-attention (MSA) for sEMG modeling by replacing the linear transformation with the proposed temporal depthwise convolution (TDC), which can reduce the convolution parameters and computations for feature learning performance. Four sEMG datasets, Ninapro DB1, DB2, DB5, and OYDB, are used for evaluations and comparisons. In the results, our model outperforms other methods, including Transformer-based networks, in most windows at recognizing the raw signals of sparse sEMG, thus achieving state-of-the-art classification accuracy.}

Previous approaches typically use sophisticated arc grouping strategies or calculate differential such as tangents, and thereby they are less efficient or more sensitive to noise. In this work, we present a novel ellipse detector, based on the simple yet effective chord computation, and on the projective invariant cross ratio, which achieves promising performance in both accuracy and efficiency. First, elliptical arcs are extracted by fast vector computations along with the removal of straight segments to speed up detection. Then, arcs from the same ellipse are grouped together according to the relative location and the intersecting chord constraints, both are on coherent chord computation without differential. Additionally, an efficient additive principle is applied to further accelerate the grouping process. Finally, a novel and robust verification by area-deduced cross ratio is introduced to pick out salient ellipses. Compared with predecessor methods, cross ratio is not only simple for computation, but also has invariant properties (used to discriminate ellipses). Extensive experiments on seven public datasets (including synthetic and real-world images) are implemented. The results highlight the salient advantages of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art detectors: Easier to implementation, more robust against occlusion and noise, as well as attaining higher F-measure.}

To alleviate the above problems, we propose the Objformer to boost point-based 3D object detection via instance-wise interaction. We design an instance feature encoder to encode clean instance features, which contain key geometric priors and holistic semantic information. Further, an instance interaction module is devised to aggregate the complementary features across instances with label-guided interaction, boosting the performance of the 3D object detection. Experiments show that Objformer outperforms previous point-based state-of-the-arts on two popular benchmarks, ScanNet V2 and SUN RGB-D. Especially, our single-modal Objformer even outperforms the competing advanced multi-modal fusion method on both SUN RGB-D and ScanNet V2.}

Despite encouraging progress, most existing end-to-end methods focus on balancing the model between detection and retrieval sub-tasks, while ignoring to enhance the learned representation for retrieval, which leads to inferior accuracy to two-step approaches. To that end, we propose a novel hierarchical framework that jointly optimizes instance-aware and part-aware embedding to enable discriminative representation learning. Specifically, we develop a region-of-interest cosegment (ROICoseg) module that captures part-aware information without requiring extra annotations to enable fine-grained discriminative representation. On top of that, a Contextual Instance Batch Sampling (CIBS) method is introduced to effectively employ contextual information for constructing training batches, thus facilitating effective instance-aware representation learning. We further introduce the first cross-door person search dataset (CDPS) that retrieves a target person in outdoor cameras with an indoor captured image or vice versa.

abstract = {Recently, several Vision Transformer (ViT) based methods have been proposed for Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC). These methods significantly surpass existing CNN-based ones, demonstrating the effectiveness of ViT in FGVC tasks. However, there are some limitations when applying ViT directly to FGVC. First, ViT needs to split images into patches and calculate the attention of every pair, which may result in heavy noise calculation during the training phase and unsatisfying performance when handling fine-grained images with complex backgrounds and small objects. Second, complementary information is important for FGVC, but a standard ViT works by using the class token in the final layer for classification which is not enough to extract comprehensive fine-grained information at different levels. Third, the class token fuses the information of all patches in the same manner, in other words, the class token treats each patch equally. However, the discriminative parts should be more critical. To address these issues, we propose ACC-ViT including three novel components, i.e., Attention Patch Combination (APC), Critical Regions Filter (CRF), and Complementary Tokens Integration (CTI). Thereinto, APC pieces informative patches from two images to generate a new image to mitigate the noisy calculation and reinforce the differences between images. CRF emphasizes tokens corresponding to discriminative regions to generate a new class token for subtle feature learning. To extract comprehensive information, CTI integrates complementary information captured by class tokens in different ViT layers. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four widely used datasets and the results demonstrate that ACC-ViT can achieve competitive performance.

Therefore, adversarial defense methods have provided an effective defense strategy to protect HSI classification networks. However, most defense models are highly dependent on known types of adversarial examples, which leads to poor generalization to defend against unknown attacks. In this study, we propose an attack-invariant attention feature-based defense (AIAF-Defense) model to improve the generalization ability of the defense model. Specifically, the AIAF-Defense model has an encoderâdecoder structure to remove the perturbations from the HSI adversarial examples. We design a feature-disentanglement network as the encoder structure to decouple the attack-invariant spectralâspatial feature and attack-variant feature in the adversarial example and apply a decoder structure to reconstruct the legitimate HSI example. In addition, an attention-guided reconstruction loss is proposed to address the attention-shift problem caused by perturbation and provide an attention constraint for the extraction of attack-invariant attention features. Extensive experiments are conducted on three benchmark hyperspectral image datasets, the PaviaU, HoustonU 2018, and Salinas datasets, and the obtained results show that the proposed AIAF-Defense model improves the defense ability on both known and unknown adversarial attacks.

To address this, we present a novel non-regularization self-supervised Retinex approach for illumination estimation. Our contributions are twofold: First, we introduce a self-supervised method that incorporates edge-aware smoothness properties in bilateral learning, eliminating the need for regularization terms and simplifying parameter adjustments. Second, to enforce smoothness constraints on the estimated bilateral grid, we propose a bilateral grid parameterization network. This network employs a generative encoder to parameterize the bilateral grid of illumination and a trainable slicing layer guided by a map, reconstructing the grid into an illumination map. Despite the absence of regularization terms, our model excels in generating piece-wise smooth illumination, resulting in enhanced naturalness and improved contrast in images. Our model offers exceptional flexibility by eliminating the need for additional regularization terms and parameter fine-tuning. Moreover, it does not depend on external datasets for training, overcoming dataset collection challenges. Extensive experiments, comparing our model with eight state-of-the-art methods across five public available datasets, unequivocally demonstrate our modelâs state-of-the-art performance based on key metrics such as NIQE, NIQMC, and CPCQI.

This paper makes an attempt to leverage contrastive learning to hypergraph representation learning. Specifically, we propose a novel method called Collaborative Contrastive Learning (CCL), which incorporates a generated standard graph with the hypergraph. The main technical contribution here is that we develop a collaborative contrastive schema, which performs contrast between the node views obtained from the standard graph and hypergraph in each network layer, thus making the contrast collaborative. To be precise, in the first layer, the view from the standard graph is used to augment that from the hypergraph. Then, in the next layer, the augmented features are adopted to train a new representation to augment the view from the standard graph conversely. With this setting, the learning procedure is alternated between the standard graph and hypergraph. As a result, the learning on the standard graph and hypergraph is collaborative and leads to the final informative node representation. Experimental results on several widely used datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed model.}

Currently, very few studies have tackled both challenges. Inspired by the success of few-shot learning, which learns a robust model from a few instances, we formulate SAR-JR as a few-shot task in a metric-learning framework to alleviate the above challenges. Against the jamming features with significant dispersion and complex geometric transformations, as well as feature obscuration in timeâfrequency images (TF), we propose an aggregated-attention deformable convolutional network (A2-DCNet) framework consisting of an aggregated-attention deformable convolutional module (A2-DC-Module) and a prototype classification module based on polynomial loss (PolyLoss-PC-Module). The former learns informative and refined embeddings from the TF images, while the latter performs the SAR-JR in an embedding space by calculating distances to prototypes of each class. Specifically, the modulated deformable convolution of the A2-DC-Module can capture long-range spatial contextual information from a global perspective, while the aggregated attention is designed to refine the representations of obscured features in the TF images. To further optimize the framework, we introduce a novel PolyLoss and customize the optimal form for our model to learn an embedding space with robust inter-class separability. Finally, to realize few-shot SAR-JR tasks, we simulate a novel dataset called JamSet. Extensive experimental results on our dataset have demonstrated substantial improvement of our proposed A2-DCNet method over the benchmarks.}
