abstract = {The revolution of technologically advanced vehicles with a high level of automation involves a profound transformation. The focus of most research in this area has been on the use of travel time for different use cases. Sleeping is one of the most time-consuming activities in everyone's life; therefore, this has been described as one of the most desired use cases for fully automated vehicles. In order to identify the best conditions to allow sleep and improve sleep quality while travelling in such vehicles, two studies were performed: a sleep study and a pressure distribution study, the results of which are included in this document. The focus of both studies was on two seat positions: reclined (60° backrest recline) and flat (87° backrest recline). In the sleep study, forty participants had the opportunity to sleep during a 90-min drive in order to evaluate long-term comfort and subjective sleep quantity and quality. Although both positions resulted in generally similar results in terms of sleep and comfort, some significant differences were identified. Karolinska Sleepiness Scale results showed that sleepiness increased in the reclined position, whereas it decreased in the flat position. Moreover, the self-reported parameter Wake After Sleep Onset was higher in the reclined position. In the pressure distribution study, it was possible to identify specific seat prototype limitations indicating inadequate support, which was related to discomfort detected during the sleep study. As a conclusion, the comparison between the reclined and flat positions showed indications that, in moving fully automated vehicles, the flat seat position is the most comfortable and effective for sleeping.}

The methods for the work activity analysis combined interviews, observations, events and operations chronicles as well as inclinometry. From the work activity analysis of the three main tasks (changing mouse cages, preparation of water bottles and unloading dirty material), difficulties such as awkward postures, heavy load handling, repetitiveness, high workload, supplementary tasks, interruptions and difficult social interactions emerged. The work activity analysis further allowed the identification of determinants of these difficulties. Some are related to the physical, organizational or social work environment, and others to the interdependence between these determinants. Such an improved understanding of ART work activity will lead to solutions best suited for MSDs prevention in this understudied setting.}

Caregivers rarely receive sufficient training, resources, or support to meet the demands associated with dementia care, which is often associated with increased risk of suboptimal outcomes. Human factors and ergonomics (HFE) can address the call for new approaches to better understand caregiving and support caregiver performance through systematic attention to and design of systems that support the work of caregivers– their care work. Thus, our objective was to perform a work system analysis of care work. We conducted a qualitative study using a Critical Incident Technique interviewing approach and Grounded Dimensional Analysis analytic procedures. Our findings introduce a new conceptual framework for understanding the care work system of dementia caregivers and suggest that care work is influenced by interactions among distinct caregiver goals, the task demands of the care needs of the person with dementia, daily life needs of the caregiver and family, and contextual factors that shape caregivers' perceptions surrounding care. The initial work system model produced by this study provides a foundation from which future work can further elucidate the care work system, determine how the care work system intersects and coordinates with other work systems such as the patient work system, and design systems that address caregivers' individual caregiving context.}

abstract = {Sedentary behavior has increased steadily over prior decades, primarily due to increased computer use at work and at home. The total sedentary time per day has been associated with increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases; increased sitting time at work has been associated with musculoskeletal discomfort particularly in the low back. Office workers spend many hours sitting, thus efforts to increase movement through changes of posture (sit to stand) or moving while sitting have been proposed as ways to mitigate the negative effects of prolonged sitting. Yet, few studies have investigated differences in the movement patterns of office workers while sitting performing their actual work. Therefore, the aim of this study was to characterize movement patterns during a prolonged sitting bout and to determine their association with musculoskeletal pain. Twenty-eight office workers participated in this field study that used a pressure sensitive mat to quantify seat pan pressure (4 regions) and trunk sway parameters over a 2-hour bout of computer work. Data were stratified by breakers who stood up at least once within the 2-hour test and prolongers who remained sitting throughout the test. Overall, there was a decreasing trend in trunk sway parameters (mean COP position, sway path, sway area, sway velocity, maximum displacement, and in-chair movements) over time (p < 0.05), with significant changes in sitting strategies. There were significant differences in trunk sway parameters and perceived musculoskeletal discomfort between breakers and prolongers with breakers having more consistent movement while sitting over the prolonged sitting bout (p < 0.05) and lower discomfort ratings. This may indicate that interrupting prolonged bouts of sitting with short periods of standing can maintain sitting movement patterns and reduce the development of musculoskeletal discomfort. Trunk sway monitoring and promoting periodic standing may be useful tools for maintaining in chair movements that may reduce or prevent the onset of musculoskeletal discomfort during prolonged sitting.}

Two types of palettes were developed for each experiment: monochrome and multi-hue. The three sets of monochrome palettes created were red, green, and blue, while four equidistant hues in the color wheel were used in the multi-hue palette: red, blue, green, and purple. A total of forty people participated in the two experiments. Participants performed two tasks for both experiments: maximum and discrimination tasks. The monochrome experiment showed the primacy of green in terms of RT and accuracy in the discrimination task. RT and accuracy were significantly affected by lightness in the multi-hue experiment. For both tasks, RT was longer for 20% lightness and lowest at 60% lightness. Accuracy results were also consistent with RT. In the discrimination task, participants made more errors in 20% lightness and the highest accuracy for 60% and 80%.}

Measurement and optimization protocols need to be developed in order to be able to monitor workers’ cognitive load. Previous studies have used electroencephalographic (EEG, measuring brain activity) and electrooculographic (EOG, measuring eye movements) signals, using basic computer-based static tasks and without creating an experience of overload. In this study, EEG and EOG data was collected of 46 participants performing an ecologically valid assembly task while inducing three levels of cognitive load (low, high and overload). The lower individual alpha frequency (IAF) was identified as a promising marker for discriminating between different levels of cognitive load and overload.}

Fatigue has been identified as a factor in 21% of high-risk incidents in the GB rail industry, and insufficient sleep and long periods of being awake are known to be two key contributors to fatigue. This paper presents evidence from a recent survey conducted in the GB rail industry, which enabled the sleep and wakefulness of railway workers to be quantified. There were 7807 responses to the survey, which represents a very large sample. Responses were primarily collected online, though paper copies were made available in some organisations. Respondents reported sleeping less when working nights, more when working days, and the most on days off, which suggests a feast-and-famine pattern of sleep. 41% were getting 6 h of sleep or less when working days, compared to 63% when working nights. Getting 6 h or less of sleep was associated with excessive daytime sleepiness. Although it is accepted that individuals’ sleep requirements vary, the patterns that shift workers reported in this survey suggest that many are not achieving the amount of sleep they need. The findings of the survey presented in this paper highlight that there is work to be done to understand and address the causes of insufficient sleep in railway workers.}

Earlier work in driving simulators confirmed the emergence of a PRP effect even if the second task (T2) was ecologically relevant, such as in a car-braking task. Here we evaluate the PRP effect if the first task (T1) is ecologically relevant as well. In a driving simulator, participants had to warn pedestrians against crossing the street (T1), and had to brake when the lead car braked (T2). As the temporal interval between tasks decreased, reaction time in T2 increased, confirming once more the emergence of a PRP effect. The PRP effect in our study was larger than in previous studies where T1 was artificial rather than ecologically relevant. This suggests that an ecologically relevant T1 is processed more elaborately, resulting in stronger interference with T2.}

An auxiliary strobe light system installed on trains in addition to existing headlights may help address this issue by providing an ergonomic way of attracting human attention to the level crossing and to the train. The objective of this paper was to investigate the ergonomics and safety potential of auxiliary strobe light systems. A system was implemented on a real railway vehicle and in the virtual environment of a driving simulator. Acceptance of the system, including its usefulness and perceived benefits and drawbacks, as well as its objective effectiveness, were evaluated using questionnaires, behavioural measures, and eye tracking. The safety potential of the system was evaluated with respect to fatal level crossing accidents. The auxiliary strobe lights were preferred over normal lights and were rated as useful, reducing driving speeds, increasing visual scanning at level crossings, and thus aiding detection of a train. The system has the potential to prevent 6–30% of level crossing accidents in Europe. The results suggest that it might be worthwhile to test auxiliary strobe lights in a larger scale real-world experiment. Especially on railway lines with a high number of passive level crossings, this system can be expected to increase safety by supporting timely detection by road users and preventing accidents caused by inattentiveness.}

Urban airports are located in city centres where drones or ‘flying cars’ would land and take off from. Previous quantitative studies have investigated passenger experience in traditional airports using field observation and surveys, but this paper is the first to present qualitative research on user experience in this emerging mobility infrastructure using an immersive VR environment. Twenty participants completed a series of six scenarios aimed at understanding customer ‘exciters’ and ‘pain points’ within an urban airport. Results and recommendations from this empirical research will help inform the design of all future mobility infrastructure solutions, through improving user experience before the infrastructure is physically deployed. Finally, this paper highlights the benefits of engaging users at an early stage of the design process to ensure that future transport infrastructure will be accessible, easy to navigate and a pleasure to use.}

abstract = {In augmented reality (AR), virtual information is optically combined with the physical environment. In the most frequently used combination technique, optical settings in AR depart from the settings in natural viewing. Depending on the combination of viewing distances of the virtual task and its physical background, this deviation may lower visual performance and cause visual disturbance symptoms. The so-called vergence-accommodation conflict (VAC) has been identified as a cause for the visual disturbance symptoms in AR. In this study, for various distance combinations, the performance and symptoms when performing a search task displayed in a see-through head-mounted display (AR HMD, HoloLens 1st generation, Microsoft, USA) was investigated. The search task was displayed at a virtual distance of either 200 cm or 30 cm, and the real background was viewed either at a distance of 200 cm or 30 cm. Three combinations of viewing distances for the background and the virtual task were studied: 200 cm/200 cm, 200 cm/30 cm, and 30 cm/30 cm. Results revealed that both performance and visual disturbance symptoms depend on the combination of the viewing distances of the physical background and the virtual task. When the physical background was viewed at a distance of 200 cm, younger participants showed a significantly better search performance and reported stronger symptoms compared with older participants, no matter whether the virtual task was performed at 30 cm or at 200 cm. However, with the physical background at a distance of 30 cm, the performance of the younger group dropped to the level of the performance of the older group, and younger participants tended to report a stronger increase in visual disturbance symptoms compared with the older participants. From the AR HMD technology used in this study, it can be concluded that a near viewing distance of the virtual task does not cause a negative impact on performance and visual disturbance symptoms, provided any physical background seen through the AR HMD is not at a near viewing distance. The findings indicate that the VAC, which persists in augmented and virtual reality, depends, in addition to the physical component evaluating the optical distance, on a cognitive component evaluating the perceived distance. AR settings should therefore also be evaluated in terms of possible effects on perceived distance.}

Collaborative robotics is one of the most promising technologies of Industry 4.0. Human-robot interaction and human-robot collaboration will be crucial for enhancing the operator's work conditions and production performance. In this regard, this enabling technology opens new possibilities but also new challenges. There is no doubt that safety is of primary importance when humans and robots interact in industrial settings. Nevertheless, human factors and cognitive ergonomics (i.e. cognitive workload, usability, trust, acceptance, stress, frustration, perceived enjoyment) are crucial, even if they are often underestimated or ignored. Therefore, this work refers to cognitive ergonomics in the design of human-robot collaborative assembly systems. A set of design guidelines has been developed according to the analysis of the scientific literature. Their effectiveness has been evaluated through multiple experiments based on a laboratory case study where different participants interacted with a low-payload collaborative robotic system for the joint assembly of a manufacturing product. The main assumption to be tested is that it is possible to improve the operator's experience and efficiency by manipulating the system features and interaction patterns according to the proposed design guidelines. Results confirmed that participants improved their cognitive response to human-robot interaction as well as the assembly performance with the enhancement of workstation features and interaction conditions by implementing an increasing number of guidelines.}

abstract = {With the introduction of Level 3 and 4 automated driving, the engagement in a variety of non-driving related activities (NDRAs) will become legal. Previous research has shown that users desire information about the remaining time in automated driving mode and system status information to plan and terminate their activity engagement. In past studies, however, the positive effect of this additional information was realized when it was integrated in or displayed close by the NDRA. As future activities and corresponding items will be diverse, a device-independent and non-interruptive way of communication is required to continuously keep the user informed, thus avoiding negative effects on driver comfort and safety. With a set of two driving simulator studies, we have investigated the effectiveness of ambient light display (ALD) concepts communicating remaining time and system status when engaged in visually distracting NDRAs. In the first study with 21 participants, a traffic light color-coded ALD concept (LED stripe positioned at the bottom of the windshield) was compared to a baseline concept in two subsequent drives. Subjects were asked to rate usability, workload, trust, and their use of travel time after each drive. Furthermore, gaze data and NDRA disengagement timing was analyzed. The ALD with three discrete time steps led to improved usability ratings and lower workload levels compared to the baseline interface without any ALD. No significant effects on trust, attention ratio, travel time evaluation, and NDRA continuation were found, but a vast majority favored the ALD. Due to this positive evaluation, the traffic light ALD concept was subsequently improved and compared to an elapsing concept in a subsequent study with 32 participants. In addition to the first study, the focus was on the intuitiveness of the developed concepts. In a similar setting, results revealed no significant differences between the ALD concepts in subjective ratings (workload, usability, trust, travel time ratings), but advantages of the traffic light concept can be found in terms of its intuitiveness and the level of support experienced.}

To compensate for this limitation, we investigated the effect of pseudo-haptics and thumb-to-finger pinch self-haptics. Three types of virtual keyboards were developed for comparison: a normal virtual keyboard without any haptic features, a pseudo-haptic keyboard providing a haptic illusion by adding pseudo-haptic features to the normal virtual keyboard, and a pinch keyboard providing passive self-haptic feedback when the index finger touches the thumb to type bubble-shaped keys. A follow-up user study was conducted on the three keyboards to measure typing performance, perceived workload, and user experience. The results showed that the pseudo-haptic and pinch keyboards were comparable to the normal one in typing performance and workload, but beneficial in user experience and preference. The findings suggest that pseudo-haptics and self-haptics could achieve experiential benefits in VR text entry without obtrusive extra devices.}

In this context, we evaluate the validity of different MSD risk assessment methods for different purposes, focusing particularly on requirements for routine workplace risk management. These include choice of fit-for-purpose assessment methods, prioritisation of hazards that are most affecting risk, and control actions as high as possible in the risk control hierarchy. Ergonomists could facilitate more effective workplace risk management by promoting: awareness of the need for change; improvements to guidance from OHS regulators; research on MSD-related workplace management issues; and professional development programs on this topic for ergonomists and other OHS practitioners.}

However, limited research has been done to investigate the proper application of MMI in AR. More specifically, the effects of combining different input and output modalities during MMI in AR are still not fully understood. Therefore, this study aims to examine the independent and combined effects of different input and output modalities during a typical AR task. 20 young adults participated in a controlled experiment in which they were asked to perform a simple identification task using an AR device in different input (speech, gesture, multimodal) and output (VV-VA, VV-NA, NV-VA, NV-NA) conditions. Results showed that there were differences in the influence of input and output modalities on task performance, workload, perceived appropriateness, and user preference. Interaction effects between the input and output conditions on the performance metrics were also evident in this study, suggesting that although multimodal input is generally preferred by the users, it should be implemented with caution since its effectiveness is highly influenced by the processing code of the system output. This study, which is the first of its kind, has revealed several new implications regarding the application of MMI in AR systems.}

The scoping literature review identified 72 relevant studies which formed the basis of the comparison. Studies reported the four selected models have similarities in terms of the sector of origin, applied sectors, output calculation, and a lack of clear guidelines on Performance Influencing Factors (PIFs) selection and risk level allocation. The studied models have differences in the number and type of PIF inputs and Human Error Probability (HEP) calculation procedures. The One Factor At a Time (OFAT) and “combined” sensitivity analysis were conducted to examine the HRA models’ responses to systematic risk level changes when each of 8 matching PIFs were systematically set to “high” and then “low” levels individually and simultaneously. The OFAT analysis showed coefficients of variation (CV) in HEP varying from 9% for skills/training up to 94% for work procedure when the PIFs are assigned to a “low” risk level individually. The combined analysis showed the median HEP value close to 97% and 1% when PIFs are assigned to” high” and “low” risk levels respectively. Although the selected HRA models were reported to be validated in high-risk domains there was no study found that validated these models in low-risk domains such as manual order picking, or manual assembly lines. The HRA models examined here are disconnected from specific system design elements which can inhibit design improvement efforts. The study outcome suggests the need for clear guidelines for PIFs selection and risk level allocation. Future research should address both the connection of error assessment to the design of the system and the features of new HRA models that affect its reliability and validity in a variety of industrial contexts.}

This study aims to investigate the benefits of unimodal tactile displays relative to other modal displays and the performance gains of adding redundant tactile displays by integrating empirical studies.
Background
Tactile displays have attracted increasing attention in recent years due to their unique advantages. Synthesizing experimental data is necessary to analyze the performance benefits of tactile displays for participants and better help practitioners in utilizing them.
Method
Five meta-analyses were conducted. Two meta-analyses compared the participants’ performance between tactile and other modal displays (visual vs. tactile and auditory vs. tactile). Three meta-analyses examined the performance gains of adding redundant tactile displays based on other modal displays (visual vs. visual + tactile, auditory vs. auditory + tactile, and visual + auditory vs. visual + auditory + tactile). The related moderator variables, the types of presented information and concurrent tasks, were analyzed.
Results
Little evidence shows the performance difference between tactile and auditory displays. Tactile displays are more beneficial than visual displays for presenting alert information or in the situation with a visual concurrent task. The performance gains of adding redundant tactile displays to other modal displays also depend on the specific type of presented information and the concurrent task.
Conclusion
When using tactile displays to convey information, interface designers should consider the specific type of presented information and the concurrent tasks.
Applications
The present study's findings can provide some implications for designers to utilize tactile displays when they construct and implement information displays.}

This paper presents a concept of eye-based maneuver control for AV-pedestrian interaction. Previously, it was unknown whether the AV should conduct a stopping maneuver when the driver looks at the pedestrian or looks away from the pedestrian. A two-agent experiment was conducted using two head-mounted displays with integrated eye-tracking. Seventeen pairs of participants (pedestrian and driver) each interacted in a road crossing scenario. The pedestrians' task was to hold a button when they felt safe to cross the road, and the drivers' task was to direct their gaze according to instructions. Participants completed three 16-trial blocks: (1) Baseline, in which the AV was pre-programmed to yield or not yield, (2) Look to Yield (LTY), in which the AV yielded when the driver looked at the pedestrian, and (3) Look Away to Yield (LATY), in which the AV yielded when the driver did not look at the pedestrian. The driver's eye movements in the LTY and LATY conditions were visualized using a virtual light beam. Crossing performance was assessed based on whether the pedestrian held the button when the AV yielded and released the button when the AV did not yield. Furthermore, the pedestrians' and drivers' acceptance of the mappings was measured through a questionnaire. The results showed that the LTY and LATY mappings yielded better crossing performance than Baseline. Furthermore, the LTY condition was best accepted by drivers and pedestrians. Eye-tracking analyses indicated that the LTY and LATY mappings attracted the pedestrian's attention, while pedestrians still distributed their attention between the AV and a second vehicle approaching from the other direction. In conclusion, LTY control may be a promising means of AV control at intersections before full automation is technologically feasible.}

The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of a secondary motor task induced by an interactive seating system (IASS) on passive driver fatigue in a monotonous simulated driving task. The effect was compared to that of a state-of-the-art massage seating system (MS), which may reduce monotony through additional tactile stimuli. The secondary objective was to compare the user experience of both systems.
Method
The independent variables were three conditions: one with the IASS, another with the MS, and a control without intervention. The study included seven dependent variables in total: a rating of subjective fatigue, three parameters measuring lane keeping ability, and three parameters reflecting fatigue-related eye movements. The duration of the simulator ride was 40 min in each condition. The study included thirty-five subjects.
Results
The assessment of subjective fatigue and lane keeping showed that the use of the IASS resulted in significantly lower passive driver fatigue compared to the massage and control conditions. The alerting effects of the IASS were also reflected by an increased eyelid distance. Frequency and duration of blinks, however, showed no clear patterns of fatigue over time in any of the conditions. Thus, both parameters did not seem be suitable to capture passive driver fatigue in this study. Regarding user experience, the subjects preferred the IASS over the MS as well.
Conclusion
The IASS showed a strong potential as an effective measure against passive driver fatigue within monotonous driving situations. The MS, on the other hand, induced no measurable effects.}

Furthermore, stressors were self-reported retrospectively and categorised as related to the job, driving conditions, personal, or other causes. Stress levels were generally low, but moderate to high stress (≥6) was more frequently reported among the tram drivers. Stressors related to the job (54%) and driving conditions (19% of all shifts) were frequently reported among the tram and truck drivers, respectively. Moderate to high stress was associated with categorised stressors related to the job and other causes among the tram drivers, and all categorised stressors among the truck drivers. Altogether, self-reported stress and stressors differ by driver group, but the role of shift type is less significant.}

Compared to novices and intermediates, the proximal joint of expert participants was less involved in the task than their distal joints. The shoulder of experts stayed closer to the trunk, while the ranges of motion of the wrist and fingers were higher. This ability enabled them to avoid lifting the arm, which was resting on the table. We observed a low cycle-to-cycle variability of the movement pattern for experts, while it was more variable in novices. Moreover, experts shared similar joints synergies attesting of an “experts” common gesture.

Selected for review were published peer-reviewed articles, conference proceedings, and gray literature relating to STFs among janitors and cleaners. Individuals employed as janitors and cleaners, specifically those that were older than 45-years of age and/or female, represented the highest risk populations for STFs. These STFs result in injuries, such as sprains, strains, dislocations, and tears. Among janitors and cleaners, 30% of nonfatal incidents are attributed to STFs, resulting in a median of 11 days away from work. Both non-observable/human factors and observable/organizational factors contribute to STFs within this population and must be addressed to protect public health. Preventive interventions focused on comprehensive approaches that target observable and non-observable factors are needed to reduce STFs within the custodial population. More research is needed on STFs in the janitorial population to identify successful preventive STF interventions. Addressing the issue of STFs within this job classification will improve the overall health and well-being of janitors as well as reduce the indirect and direct economic burden placed on the employer organization.}

The research method included a selection and grouping of measures, definition of assessment criteria, a literature review and compilation of assessment forms, and a workshop for experts in the field. We assessed 21 measures based on 12 specified criteria. Specifically, the aim of these criteria was to support the identification and structuring of the available information on each measure to be in easily exploitable format for railway stakeholders. The measures were listed in order of priority in three categories based on final assessments from the workshop. The measures categorised as top priority with the highest potential to reduce suicides on Finnish railways included training of railway personnel to identify suicidal people (also called Gatekeeper training), camera surveillance, detection systems (radar, movement sensors, etc.), collaboration between organisations, learning from international experience, cooperation between railway organisations, police and fire and rescue services, and training of mental health providers. This prioritisation, together with the information included in the assessment forms and expert's views related to each measure, support the Finnish railway stakeholders in selecting measures and defining implementation strategies to prevent railway suicides on Finnish railways. The insights of Finnish experts on the effectiveness and potential implementation of these different measures are valuable information also for railway stakeholders in other countries when selecting appropriate measures to prevent railway suicides. The results of this study support the safe and effective functioning of the railway system by adding knowledge that will help effectively prevent railway suicides and loss of life, delays to train traffic, and work-related stress and trauma to railway staff, rescue personnel and eyewitnesses.}

Train occupancy information has been introduced as a tool to stimulate passengers' behaviour change to ease in-vehicle crowding. However, there are limitations to this strategy as it often fails to consider other elements in the complex rail system that influence behaviour. This research provides insights to service providers to promote passenger behaviour change by revealing the behavioural constraints in the environment. Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA) was applied to systematically analyse passengers’ behaviour and related constraints in the environment. Specifically, Work Domain Analysis (WDA) and Social Organisation and Cooperation Analysis (SOCA) were conducted and presented in the forms of Abstraction Hierarchy (AH) and Contextual Activity Template (CAT). Results showed that a wide range of informational, navigational and physical support alongside provision of occupancy information could better encourage passengers to select and use less busy carriages and trains. Behaviour change goals are likely to be achieved more effectively when the constraints of the system are better understood.}

Investigate the influence of sex, strength capacity, and relative load mass on low-back exposure and lower extremity joint power generation in backboard lifting.
Background
Sex and strength have been shown to influence lifting strategy, but without load mass being scaled to strength it is unknown which factor influences low-back exposures, and whether there are interactions with load mass.
Methods
Motion capture and force plate data from 28 participants were collected during backboard lifting at load masses scaled to strength capacity. Differences in normalized peak low-back moment, peak knee-to-hip power magnitude ratio and timing were tested as a function of sex, strength, and load mass.
Results
Stronger participants had lower normalized peak low-back moments (average 32% change from low-capacity across all load masses), with no significant sex effect (p = 0.582). As load mass increased, normalized peak low-back moment, peak knee-to-hip power magnitude and synchronicity decreased.
Conclusion
Training to both increase strength capacity and hip-joint power generation may be a strategy to reduce low-back exposure in backboard lifting.}

The eye movements of sixty Naval flight students were tracked as workload transitioned at a slow, medium, and fast pace in an unmanned aerial vehicle testbed. Four scan-based metrics were significant predictors across the different growth curve models of response time and accuracy. Stationary gaze entropy (a measure of how dispersed visual attention transitions are across tasks) was predictive across all three transition rates. The other three predictive scan-based metrics captured different aspects of visual attention, including its spread, directness, and duration. The findings specify several missing details in both theory and design guidance, which is unprecedented, and serves as a basis of future workload transition research.}

Mental workload was evaluated using a modified, raw NASA-TLX and clustered with a k-means clustering algorithm. Mixed effects logistic regression and Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR) was utilized for analysis. Average noise exposure, the difference between peak and mean noise exposure, and the number of peaks >135 dB were each strongly associated with mental workload, while the kurtosis and standard deviation of noise throughout a shift were not. An exposure-response relationship between average noise exposure and mental workload may exist, with elevated risk of high mental workload beginning at 80 dBA. These results suggest that high noise exposure may be an independent risk factor of high mental workload, and impulse events and the difference between the peak and mean noise exposure may have interactive effects with average noise exposure.}

abstract = {Objective
To test six different methods of directing a user's attention in a peripheral head mounted display assisted visual search task.
Background
Each time a user needs to shift their attention between virtual information and their environment has a cost. The faster a user can process a guiding cue and the fewer times they need to return to it, the more efficient that cue will be at directing a user's attention. The most effective method, creating a visual effect at the location of the target, is not suitable for peripheral head mounted displays. This study tests alternative guiding cues better suited to these devices.
Method
Participants searched for a singleton target hidden among 299 distractors while directed with one of six device-delivered guiding cues. Search times were recorded.
Results
A static region map was the most efficient and most preferred cue. Static and dynamic directional cues were also effective in comparison to non-guided search. Cues designed to work solely within the participants’ peripheral vision were relatively ineffective
Conclusion
Guidance cues that direct a user's attention to targets within the real environment do not need to precisely lead to the target. It is instead more efficient to lead a user to the general vicinity of the target quickly and then have the user revert to their natural visual search behaviour.
Application
This finding is broadly useful when assisting visual search tasks with handheld or worn devices which do not cover the user's full field of view.
Précis
This study tested six different methods of guiding attention in a peripheral head-mounted display assisted visual search task. This study compared static, dynamic and peripheral-vision endogenous cues to targets and found a static simple map cue both fastest and most preferred by users.}

Overall, self-reported sleep durations were substantially longer than actigraphic estimates (mean bias of −30.6 min; limits of agreement −95.9 to 34.8 min), and the discrepancy was mainly caused by differences in two methods to track sleep onset latency and Wake-up After Sleep Onset (WASO). Based on a customised activity log, a strong positive correlation (rho = 0.75, p < .001) between self-report and actigraphy was observed for sleep duration estimates, which confirmed the effectiveness of the activity log in field studies. Between two participant groups with different work schedules, the agreement between self-report and actigraphy was consistently better for day workers than watch keepers.

abstract = {Objective
To assess whether the capacity to utilize cues amongst emergency physicians is associated with differences in the capacity to recover performance following an interruption.
Background
Interruptions are implicated in errors in emergency medicine due to the cognitive load that they impose on working memory, resulting in a loss of performance on the primary task. The utilization of cues is associated with a reduction in cognitive load during the performance of a task, thereby enabling the allocation of residual resources that mitigates the loss of performance following interruptions.
Method
Thirty-nine emergency physicians, recruited at a medical conference, completed an assessment of cue utilization (EXPERTise 2.0) and an online simulation (Septris) that involved the management of patients presenting with sepsis. During the simulation, physicians were interrupted and asked to check a medication order. Task performance was assessed using scores on Septris, with points awarded for the accurate management of patients.
Results
Emergency physicians with higher cue utilization recorded significantly higher scores on the simulation task following the interruption, compared to physicians with lower cue utilization (p = .028).
Conclusion
The results confirm a relationship between cue utilization and the recovery of performance following an interruption. This is likely due to the advantages afforded by associated reductions in cognitive load.
Application
Assessments of cue utilization may assist in the development of interventions to support clinicians in interruptive environments.}

In this study, sixteen participants performed lifting/lowering and instrument findings tasks on each table, where kinematics, kinetics, subjective, and performance-related measures were recorded. Results indicated that MTT required lesser shoulder flexion (p-value<0.001), ∼14% lower shoulder loads (0.012), task completion time (<0.001), and cognitive/physical workloads (<0.004). Although peak low-back demands were ∼15% higher using MTT, the number of lifts to complete the same task was 60% lower, leading to lower cumulative demand on the low-back musculature. Utilizing MTT in OR could reduce demand and increase nurses' efficiency, leading to reduced risk of WMSDs and the total time of surgery.}

abstract = {Objective
We examined the impact of performing a cognitive task of varying loads and kayaking simultaneously, compared to performance on the same tasks individually.
Background
When two tasks are performed together, performance often suffers compared to performance on either task alone. Interference not only occurs in competing cognitive tasks, but has also been found with certain physically demanding activities, such as climbing.
Method
Skilled kayakers performed a kayak course on open water, performed a high and a low cognitive load tone counting task, and also performed the kayak and counting tasks simultaneously.
Results
Despite some past research finding dual task facilitation with laboratory aerobic activities, simultaneous kayaking and tone counting led to dual-task interference.
Conclusion
Concurrent counting and kayaking led to performance impairments in both tasks, relative to single task performance.
Application
The present results are applicable to occupations involving concurrent demanding physical activity and cognitive task performance, such as the work of first responders and military operators.
Précis
Kayaking, like climbing, appears to hinder cognitive performance more than the low-risk physical tasks carried out in laboratory conditions.}

Driving is a complex task, which requires the cognitive and physical ability to predict, identify, and respond to hazards to avoid crashing. However, research exploring the factors that influence safe driving behaviour for chronic pain individuals is limited. A qualitative study was conducted which involved semi-structured interviews with 23 people who had experienced persistent pain for at least three months and 17 health professionals who had experience working with individuals with chronic pain. The aim of this study was to obtain a deeper understanding of the experiences and challenges that people with chronic pain may have in their day-to-day driving. Participants were also asked about currently available driving assessments and strategies for individuals with chronic pain in the Australian healthcare system. The themes emerging from the interviews highlighted the need for clearer guidelines and educational materials regarding the impact of chronic pain on an individual's ability to drive. These themes included the physical and cognitive challenges resulting from chronic pain, as well as the potential side effects of pain medications. In addition, participants identified a number of self-regulation strategies and driving assessments currently available for monitoring safe driving behaviour in Australia. This study improves our understanding of how chronic pain affects driving behaviour, as reported by individuals experiencing the pain and relevant health professionals. Recommendations for improving the safety of drivers with chronic pain are discussed, including possible technological interventions and better public education.}

The frequency analysis revealed that not following procedure (22 observations), training inadequate or unavailable (17), inadequate regulatory oversight (17), inadequate procedure guidance (16), company management absent or deficient (10) and incorrect manuals/charts/checklists (9) were the most frequent contributing factors. Since none of the existing models could summarize the root causes of 22 occurrences effectively, a scenario-based human-machine-environment-procedure (HMEP) classification scheme was proposed to use organizational influences, people management, technical failure, procedure and document, and environment as the first-layer subcategories. The HMEP scheme was additionally applied to the analysis and coding of 4 helicopter accidents in the USA published by the NTSB. The HMEP scheme revealed that NTSB had identified a significantly greater number of root causes in the manufacturer design, manufacturing & documentation. Overall, HMEP can be used to guide the data collection during accident investigation and subsequently to aggregate aviation accidents to derive recurring factors and compare accident patterns in an efficient manner.}

abstract = {Introduction
Excessive physical shoulder musculoskeletal loading (muscle and joint contact forces), known to contribute to work-related shoulder disorders, can be reduced by a passive shoulder exoskeleton during quasi-static tasks. However, its effect on neighboring joints i.e. elbow, lower back, hip, and knee and its effect on joint contact forces have not been investigated. Furthermore, the effect of the exoskeleton's assistance versus movement adaptation when wearing the exoskeleton on musculoskeletal loading remains unexplored.
Methods
3D motion capture and ground reaction forces were measured while 16 participants performed 5 simulated occupational tasks with and without the exoskeleton. A musculoskeletal modeling workflow was used to calculate musculoskeletal loading. Shoulder muscle fatigue was quantified using surface EMG. In addition, exoskeletons usability was quantified using the system usability scale.
Results
When wearing the passive shoulder exoskeleton, shoulder and elbow musculoskeletal loading decreased during the high lift and overhead wiring task, without increasing the musculoskeletal load at the back, hip and knee. In contrast, musculoskeletal loading in the shoulder, as well as in the knee increased while lifting a box from the ground to knee height and from elbow height to shoulder height. When wearing the exoskeleton, muscle activity of the Trapezius descendens, Deltoideus medius and Biceps brachii were reduced during the high lift.
Conclusion
The passive shoulder exoskeleton reduces musculoskeletal loading in the lower back, shoulder and elbow during simulated occupational tasks above shoulder height. In contrast, for tasks below shoulder height, the use of the exoskeleton needs to be critically reviewed to avoid increased musculoskeletal loading also in neighboring joints due to altered movement execution when wearing the exoskeleton.}

abstract = {Background
Most adults prefer to age in place. However, the majority of homes are not designed to support resident needs, especially for adults undergoing joint replacement surgeries such as total knee arthroplasty (TKA) or total hip arthroplasty (THA). It is of paramount importance to proactively assess and modify the homes of adults undergoing TKA/THA such that they can safely transition home following surgery. Several tools utilize emerging technology like virtual reality, augmented reality, or teleconferencing to assess home environments. These are meant to be used by professionals like occupational therapists. However, the acceptance and uptake of simple technology like mobile applications for assessing homes proactively by residents has not been explored.
Objective
A qualitative exploratory study was conducted to evaluate the feasibility and potential acceptance of a mobile application for resident-initiated home assessment.
Methods
Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 22 patient-care partner dyads before and after THA/TKA to understand the perceived usefulness, likelihood of using a mobile application-based home assessment tool, and perceived barriers and facilitators of using the tool.
Results
About 68% of the patient-care partner dyads interviewed for this study perceived benefits of using a mobile application-based tool. All the participants who perceived the tool to be useful showed high likelihood of using it. A comparison of responses between pre-and post-surgery interviews revealed that around 50% of participants showed an increased intention of using an assessment tool after experiencing challenges in their homes post-surgery. Participants provided recommendations for key content, potential features to include in the assessment tool, and preferred formats (e.g., checklists, visuals, and videos).
Conclusions
To increase acceptance of a mobile application-based home assessment tool, it is crucial that residents are made aware of the home environment challenges and the importance of an assessment tool to improve their safety and independence. The content, features, formats, and usability suggestions from the participants in this study provide a framework for health mobile application and interface developers to design a home assessment tool.}

Reaching was quantified as the maximum lateral center of pressure (COP) displacement from the ladder's center. A reach was classified as an overreach when the COP displaced outside the ladder width, indicative of a ladder tip. Reaching disposition, remaining debris, ladder position, and the interaction of reaching disposition and remaining debris predicted 20% of the reaching variability during the ladder task. Overreaching was observed in 40% of participants accounting for 13% of all extended reaches (beyond ladder). This work can guide interventions on mitigating overreaching and improving ladder safety.}

The participants’ behavior, driving-related data, and emotional responses were recorded and analyzed. The results revealed that the trigger time to collision (TTC) between the lane changer and the following vehicle in the target lane and communication types were all important factors influencing the willingness of drivers to cooperate. V2V communication could significantly increase the willingness of the driver in the following vehicle to cooperate compared to the traditional method in which desire to change lanes is conveyed with only turn lights. The effect of different communication contents on willingness to cooperate did not vary significantly; however, emotional communication was superior to rational communication in some cases. This indicates that changing lanes owing to an emergency was more likely to be successful.

abstract = {Previously, we observed no significant reductions in sitting time of the multicomponent Dynamic Work (DW) intervention among office workers. In this study we used mixed-method data to understand context, implementation (i.e. recruitment and delivery) and mechanism of impact (i.e. experiences) of the DW intervention and to explore whether an higher implementation index score led to larger changes in participants’ outcomes. We found considerable variation across departments regarding context (i.e. different size and work tasks) and implementation (i.e. delivery varied). Satisfaction with the DW intervention was high. An higher implementation index score was associated with lower overall sitting time, lower occupational sitting time, higher number of steps/day and steps/day at work at 4-months, which was maintained at 8-month for occupational sitting time. These findings provide an understanding that implementation was affected by a lack of availability of intervention components, department policy, work tasks, positioning and work location.

The results found the foot breadth of firefighters was larger than the general population and the feet of female firefighters were slimmer than males. Furthermore, it revealed that the feet of firefighters became longer, wider, and flatter when bearing the weight of fire gear. Protective boots should be designed based on the foot shape and dimensions of the actual population, with consideration of sex differences and the impact of weight-bearing for their safety.}

Primary analysis was conducted to detect changes in mean work ability scores between baseline and three-year follow-up for all workers who completed the surveys (matched and unmatched), and all workers who were ≥50 years of age (matched and unmatched). There were no significant differences between the two time periods. A secondary analysis was undertaken to examine associations between risk factors and work ability scores. This identified that six of the 18 psychosocial risk factors, and three of the eight physical risk factors associated with reduced work ability at baseline were no longer significant. These results indicate that the APHIRM toolkit may be effective in identifying hazards which, if addressed, could contribute to the maintenance of work ability over time.}

Interviews were held with 22 pilots (Study 1) and 17 maritime safety stakeholders (Study 2) in the New Zealand maritime context. The findings illustrate the challenges pilots face during pilotage and provide insights into their decision-making processes and the systemic factors that can be addressed to improve maritime safety. Given the multiple causal pathways to incidents occurring during pilotage identified by this research, it is suggested that multiple systems-wide interventions are needed, which is likely to require a long-term, strategic approach.}

This paper discusses how the increasing availability of operational data can be used to develop an understanding of train driver reliability. The paper derives human reliability data for two driving tasks, stopping at red signals and controlling speed on approach to buffer stops. In the first of these cases, a tool has been developed that can estimate the number of times a signal is approached at red by trains on the Great Britain (GB) rail network. The tool has been developed using big data techniques and ideas, recording and analysing millions of pieces of data from live operational feeds to update and summarise statistics from thousands of signal locations in GB on a daily basis. The resulting driver reliability data are compared to similar analyses of other train driving tasks. This shows human reliability approaching the currently accepted limits of human performance. It also shows higher error rates amongst freight train drivers than passenger train drivers for these tasks. The paper highlights the importance of understanding the task specific performance limits if further improvements in human reliability are sought. It also provides a practical example of how big data could play an increasingly important role in system error management, whether from the perspective of understanding normal performance and the limits of performance for specific tasks or as the basis for dynamic safety indicators which, if not leading, could at least become closer to real time.}

In Experiment 1 automation reliability successively switched from high to low (or vice versa). In Experiment 2 automation reliability decreased by varying magnitudes before returning to high. Participants did not initially calibrate to true reliability and experiencing low automation reliability reduced future reliability estimates when experiencing subsequent high reliability. Automation acceptance was predicted by positive differences between participant perception of automation reliability and confidence in their own manual classification reliability. Experiencing low automation reliability caused perceptions of reliability and automation acceptance rates to diverge. These findings have important implications for training and adaptive human-automation teaming in complex work environments.}

The field work included interviews with signallers and operations managers along with observations of signaller work. The results showed that the local knowledge framework needs to be expanded to include aspects related to the general public at user worked crossings and level crossings. In addition, the analysis highlights some of the issues with the transmission of local knowledge. The paper then discusses some of the gaps in the current framework, highlighting the importance not only of local knowledge for specific functions of signalling, but how these interact to support trade-offs to balance performance with safety. The implications for the design of signaller work are discussed.}

Since eye movements and steering control are closely coupled, this study investigated how the presence of a shoulder influences drivers' gaze strategies. To this end, eighteen drivers negotiated right-hand bends with and without a shoulder on a simulated rural road. In the presence of a shoulder, participants modified their visual sampling of the road by directing their gaze further inside the bend. At the same time, their lane position was deviated inward throughout the bend and the vehicle spent more time out of the lane. These results suggest that the shoulder influences the visual processes involved in trajectory planning. Recommendations are made to encourage drivers to keep their eyes and vehicle in the driving lane when a shoulder is present.}

In session 2, 10 participants performed 50 box lifting repetitions with and without the LiftSuit. In session 1, the exosuit was considered mildly to moderately helpful, and reduced erector spinae and middle trapezius electromyograms. In session 2, the exosuit was not considered helpful, but reduced the middle trapezius electromyogram and trunk and thigh ranges of motion. These effects are likely due to placement of elastic elements and excessive stiffness at the hips. Overall, the LiftSuit appears suboptimal for long-term use, though elastic elements on the upper back may reduce muscle activation in future exosuit designs.}

Fatigue is one of the main contributors to musculoskeletal disorders. Thus, this study investigated fatigue detection based on the measured body motion by wearable inertial measurement units. We quantified the body motion during manual handling tasks using a novel kinematic score (i.e., K-score), and the Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA). K-score and REBA were calculated using joint angles. Nevertheless, unlike REBA, K-score showed a significant correlation (Spearman's correlation coefficient of ρ(302) = 0.21, p < 0.05) with electromyography (EMG) signal amplitude, which was affected by muscle fatigue. Therefore, in-field measurement of K-score using inertial measurement units could detect the fatigue-induced change of body motion in long-duration manual handling tasks. Our proposed K-score can be used to assess fatigue-related ergonomic risk in long-term and real-world working conditions without the need for tedious EMG recording at workplaces.}

We also evaluated whether a ‘targetless’ search strategy – in which screeners identify and reject safe items – improved detection relative to target-based methods. In an online study, 104 novice screeners were trained with either CT or DV, and either a targetless or a target-based search strategy. Screeners were then tested in a simulated cabin baggage screening task. CT screeners performed with greater sensitivity than DV screeners. Search strategy did not affect sensitivity, although the target-based strategy resulted in a more liberal criterion. We conclude that CT imaging confers a benefit to screening performance over DV when image resolution is controlled. This is likely due to the ability to rotate the image to resolve occlusions.}

Findings show decreased level of PA amongst WFH office workers and that the activity tracker and survey are reliable methods of recording WFH PA.}

abstract = {Studies examining the potential of augmented reality (AR) to improve assembly tasks are often unrepresentative of real assembly line conditions and assess mental workload only through subjective measurements and leads to conflicting results. We proposed a study directly carried out in industrial settings, to compare the impact of AR-based instructions to computerized instructions, on assembly effectiveness (completion time and errors) and mental workload using objective (eye tracking), subjective (NASA-TLX) and behavioral measurements (dual task paradigm). According to our results, AR did not improve effectiveness (increased assembly times and no decrease in assembly errors). Two out of three measurements indicated that AR led to more mental workload for simple assembly workstation, but equated computer instructions for complex workstation. Our data also suggest that, AR users were less able to detect external events (danger, alert), which may play an important role in the occurrence of work accidents.}

The current study evaluated upper extremity muscular loads associated with household floor vacuuming with the high CoM stick vacuum cleaners. Twenty participants conducted vacuuming on tiled and carpeted floors with straight and curved back-and-forth motions using medium (2.92 kg) and heavier weight (3.56 kg) cordless stick vacuums. The myoelectric signals of their upper extremity muscles were quantified during vacuuming. Mean normalized activity ranged from 8.2% to 20.2% of the maximum contraction capacity, with greater activity when vacuuming carpeted floors with a heavier vacuum cleaner. Study findings indicate that floor vacuuming with a cordless stick vacuum may not be as ergonomically efficient as assumed by their lighter weight. Instead, it is a physically demanding housekeeping activity that needs ergonomic attention.}

Three feasible cooling methods for treatment of hyperthermic individuals in the military, that differed considerably in water volume needed (none to ~80 L), were evaluated.
Methods
Ten male soldiers were cooled following exercise-induced hyperthermia (rectal temperature (Tre) ∼39.5 °C) using ventilation by fanning (1.7 m s−1), ventilation by fanning (1.7 m s−1) while wearing a wet t-shirt (250 mL–27 °C water) and tarp assisted cooling with oscillations (80 L of 27.2 ± 0.5 °C water; TACO).
Results
Cooling rates were higher using TACO (0.116 ± 0.032 °C min−1) compared to ventilation (0.065 ± 0.011 °C min−1, P<0.001) and ventilation in combination with a wet t-shirt (0.074 ± 0.020 °C min−1, P=0.002). Time to cool (TTC) to Tre=38.2 °C for TACO was shorter (14 ± 4 min) compared to ventilation only (20 ± 5 min; P=0.018), but not to ventilation while wearing a wet t-shirt (18 ± 6 min; P=0.090).
Conclusions
TACO may be an acceptable, efficient and feasible cooling method in case of exertional heat stroke. However, in case of limited water availability, transportat should be prioritized, and cooling of any form should be implemented while waiting for and during transport.}

The aim of this study was to inform recommendations regarding reaction load exposures from right-angle nutrunners. Through a psychophysics approach, experienced assembly workers subjectively assessed reaction loads when using a nutrunner in six combinations of tool tightening strategy, work-pace and screw-joint stiffness. Electromyography, tool and joint parameters were measured. Regardless of tightening strategy, joint stiffness and work-pace combinations, no large differences in acceptable tightening torque, peak reaction force, and handle displacement were observed. However, acceptable jerk and impulse differed substantially between the TurboTight® (high-acceleration) and QuickStep® (conventional) tightening strategies. Although the TurboTight® strategy overall showed reduced peak muscular activities compared to the QuickStep®, the participant-rated acceptable torque levels were similar, plausibly due to TurboTights’ high jerk levels. Jerk and impulse are hypothesized to influence the perception of reaction loads.}

Sixteen civilians and 12 soldiers performed eight military-based movement patterns under three body-borne loads: ∼5.5 kg, ∼22 kg, and ∼38 kg. Our framework reduces dimensionality using principal component analysis and uses linear discriminant analysis to classify groups and morph movement patterns. Our framework produces morphed whole-body movement patterns that emulate previously published changes to the survivability tradespace caused by body-borne loads. Additionally, we identified that personal characteristics can greatly impact the tradespace when carrying heavy body-borne loads. Using our framework, military leaders can make decisions based on objective information for armour procurement, employment of armour, and battlefield performance, which can positively impact operational readiness and increase overall mission success.}

Emerging technologies may lead to more task interruptions. This study examines the effects of task attributes and mental fatigue on interrupted task performance in a concurrent multitasking environment. Thirty-four participants performed the MATB-Ⅱ under eight conditions (two-level task interruption, two-level task complexity, two-level fatigue). The results revealed the significant interaction effects of interruption × task complexity and of interruption × fatigue state. The findings show that more time is required to return to a complex primary task, and there are differences among subtask types. Mental fatigue negatively affects primary task performance, workload, and the resumption lag after an interruption. The findings are explained by the increasing information cues needed to resume complex tasks and the negative effect of fatigue on memory activation.}

It is therefore necessary to identify improved thermal settings for the bus cabin to minimize the energy consumption, while guaranteeing good thermal comfort. To achieve this goal, this paper presents the results of climatic measurements in an electric bus in Berlin, Germany. These measurements were performed for outer temperatures between 5.3 °C and 7.8 °C and four cabin temperature settings. During the measurements, several climatic parameters and the energy consumption were measured, whereas the thermal comfort (TC) was evaluated via 71 passengers’ surveys. The results show that the climatic conditions in the bus vary greatly depending on the position (up to 3 K difference in mean air temperature) and height (up to 8 K/m temperature-to-height ratio). Additionally, the surveys show that the mean value of the thermal comfort parameter TC is minimized to a value of 0.15 (corresponding to “comfortable” thermal perception) for a set temperature of 21 °C, whereas the thermal conditions are perceived as acceptable even with heating off.}

There are traditionally two approaches to developing gestural technology systems: a human-based approach where usability is maximized and a technology-based approach where system accuracy is maximized. The tradeoff between usability and accuracy may negatively affect the overall trust and reliability in the system. Therefore, this study seeks to redefine the human-based approach to gestural system development by introducing a bottom-up approach to identifying the lower-level features that produce a gesture, thus allowing the technology to accurately recognize features. A user elicitation study was performed, and gestures were classified according to a novel feature extraction gesture taxonomy and a traditional taxonomy of classifying gestures as a unit. The feature-extraction approach revealed several advantages because it fosters a bottom-up approach to identifying gesture features. Using this approach may mitigate the effects of the usability-accuracy tradeoff in gestural system development.}

Before exoskeletons are broadly integrated into unstructured environments, it will be important to evaluate exoskeletons in a broader set of relevant tasks. A balance beam traverse was used to represent a constrained foot placement task for examining balance and stability. Participants (n = 17) completed the task in their own shoes (Pre-Exoskeleton and Post-Exoskeleton trials), and when wearing a lower-limb exoskeleton (Dephy ExoBoot) in both powered and unpowered states. Data were collected via inertial measurement units (on the torso and feet) and analyzed on a pooled level (with data from all participants) and on an individual level (participant-specific confidence intervals). When examining pooled data, it was observed that the exoskeleton had mixed effects on stride stability metrics. When compared to the Post-Exoskeleton shoe control, it was observed that stride duration was increased when wearing the exoskeleton (both powered and unpowered states), while normalized stride length and stride speed were not affected. Despite the changes in stride stability, overall balance (as measured by torso sway) remained unaffected by exoskeleton state. On an individual level, it was observed that not all participants followed these general trends, and within each metric, some increased, some decreased, and some had no change in the Powered Exoskeleton condition when compared to the Post-Exoskeleton Shoe condition: normalized stride length (0% increased, 12% decreased, 88% no change), stride duration (35% increased, 0% decreased, 65% no change), and torso sway (0% increased, 12% decreased, 88% no change). Our findings suggest that the lower-limb exoskeleton evaluated can be used during tasks that require balancing, and we recommend that balancing tasks be included in standards for exoskeleton evaluation.}

The data confirm the relevance of expectations regarding improvements of workplace design and employee well-being, as well as concerns about restrictions of employees' privacy and sovereignty, for the implementation of workload monitoring. Furthermore, Bayesian regression models show that the examined expectations have a substantial positive association with managers’ willingness to support workload monitoring in their company. Privacy concerns are identified as a significant barrier to the acceptance of workload monitoring, both in terms of their prevalence among managers and their strong negative relationship with monitoring support.}

abstract = {Background and aims
Musculoskeletal (MSK) injuries among gastroenterologists are common. Our study describes risk factors and consequences of injury by comparing provider-specific anthropometric and objective procedural data to self-reported injury patterns.
Methods
A validated MSK symptom survey was sent to gastroenterologists to gauge prevalence, distribution, and severity of active injury. Respondents’ procedural activities over 7 years were collected via an endoscopic database.
Results
64 surveys were completed. 54 respondents had active pain; 53.1% reported activity-limiting injury. Activity-limiting injuries lead to longer colonoscopy times (25.3 vs. 22.1 min, P = 0.03) and lower procedural volumes (532 vs. 807, P = 0.01). Hand/wrist injuries yielded longer colonoscopy insertion times (9.35 vs. 8.21 min, P = 0.03) and less hands-on scope hours (81.2 vs. 111.7 h, P = 0.04). Higher esophagogastroduodenoscopy volume corelated with shoulder injury (336.5 vs. 243.1 EGDs/year, P = 0.04). Females had more foot injuries (P = 0.04).
Conclusion
Activity-limiting MSK symptoms/injuries affect over 50% of endoscopists with negative impact on procedural volume and efficiency.}
