abstract = {Deficits in the accommodative and/or vergence responses have been linked with inattentive behavioral symptoms. While using automated systems (e.g., self-driving cars, autopilot), operators (e.g., drivers, pilots, soldiers) visually monitor displays for critical changes, making deficits in the accommodative and/or vergence responses potentially hazardous for individuals remaining actively engaged in the task at hand. The purpose of this study was to determine if symptoms of accommodative-vergence deficits predict an individual's level of task engagement and cognitive fatigue while performing a flight simulation task with or without automation. Eighty-four participants performed a flight simulation task with or without automation. Prior to task completion, self-report accommodative-convergence deficit symptoms were assessed with the Convergence Insufficiency Symptom Survey (CISS). Before and after the flight simulation task participants rated their task engagement and cognitive fatigue. Electroencephalographic activity (EEG) was recorded concurrently during task performance. Results showed that higher scores on the CISS were related to increased feelings of fatigue and decreased ratings of task engagement. The CISS was also positively related to parietal-occipital fast alpha power during the last 10 min of the task for participants using automation, suggesting increased cortical idling. CISS scores did not predict performance. Results have implications for optimizing operator cognitive states over extended task performance.}

Medication transitions are a particularly vulnerable type of patient work transitions. We describe two cases of medication transitions—new medications and medication deprescribing—in which the patient work lens reveals many accompanying changes, vulnerabilities, and opportunities for human factors and ergonomics.}

This study aimed 1) to investigate the effect of a newly designed heat-reduction mastectomy bra on the thermal responses and thermal comfort performance; and 2) to propose an evaluation protocol for post-mastectomy products. The heat-reduction bra and the conventional bra were made of the same textile materials but the cup of the bra under discussion had a polyurethane cup with a perforated structure along the breast root/inframammary fold. The inframammary fold is often aggravated by heat, sweat, maceration, chafe, and lack of air circulation. Nine healthy male participants were recruited to participate in the study since the women who had undergone double-mastectomy were sensitive about their scars. An ingestible telemetric pill sensor was used to collect the data of core body temperature. Participants performed a 70-min five-phase exercise protocol wearing the heat-reduction bra and the conventional bra together with a silicone prosthesis with ventilation holes on the bottom. Physiological responses (i.e., core body temperature, skin temperature, temperature between bra and prosthesis, skin humidity and humidity between bra and prosthesis) and subjective sensation responses were measured. The results were statistically significant and the conventional mastectomy bra showed a higher core body temperature than that of the heat-reduction mastectomy bra (37.3 ± 0.3 °C to 38.2 ± 0.5 °C vs. 37.2 ± 0.3 °C to 38.0 ± 0.3 °C) starting from the middle of the sitting phase to the running phase and post-exercise resting (F = 164.2, p < 0.001). Both factors, the bra and the phase, have significant effects on the core body temperature (F = 14.5, p < 0.001).

abstract = {This research represents one of the first qualitative studies to investigate fatigue in the tunnelling sector of the construction industry. It explores the opinions of tunnellers and their managers about how fatigue influences or is influenced by tunnelling, and how this is managed. Fatigue and sleepiness were discussed in six focus groups with frontline workers (n = 42) and 10 manager interviews. Fatigue was seen to be a problem, with all participants having experienced, or recognised in others, the feeling of sleepiness whilst at work. Fatigue and sleepiness are not commonly discussed between tunnelling workers and they do not feel comfortable reporting instances of fatigue. The research shows that workers in the tunnelling construction sector are exposed to a wide range of occupational factors that potentially increase their vulnerability to fatigue, including the physical environment, repetitive and monotonous tasks, variable shift patterns and manual work. Additionally, personal factors such as social and family demands, long commute times and living away from home, can increase the risk of fatigue. The construction industry in general has gone some way to address fatigue and there is opportunity to further improve fatigue management. However, a major shift is needed before workers will feel able to openly discuss fatigue with their employer.}

The influence of surface height, number of pills and device orientation were studied in twelve muscles of the upper extremity. Variations in the work surface height and number of pills crushed resulted in static shoulder and forearm muscle activations that exceeded recommended static limits. In most cases, working at approximately a 50th percentile female's hip height (87 cm) reduced the level of muscle activity, often to below the EMG-based exposure limit, compared to higher heights. A perpendicularly oriented device required substantially lower muscle activity in some shoulder muscles, with marginal differences occurring in muscles of the elbow and wrist. These data can inform practical design and work practice recommendations to reduce muscular activity while performing this important healthcare task.}

Both immersiveness and perceptibility affected overall preference ratings. Participants gave higher preference ratings to the convex and concave displays, which were rated high in immersiveness and perceptibility, but gave lower preference ratings to the hemisphere/spherical display which had high ratings on immersiveness but low ratings on perceptibility. The study results imply that curved displays do indeed create a feeling of immersiveness. Concave and convex displays were rated highly favorably and should receive more attention for applications where visual experience and a feeling of immersiveness is particularly important.}

The Apgar score at birth predicted positive results. For neonates with poor and intermediate Apgar scores, culture results for monitored infants were more likely to be positive than those for unmonitored infants. Thus, the medical staff tended to monitor infants who eventually had a greater chance for positive test results. A cost-effectiveness analysis indicated that for infants with high Apgar scores, the physician should decide whether to obtain a blood culture, based on the patient's characteristics. For infants with lower Apgar scores, it may be advisable to obtain a blood culture whenever one decides to monitor a neonate. The study demonstrates that staff decisions regarding a patient can serve as input for further clinical decision-making.}

Three levels of automation transparency were manipulated between-participants. Providing transparency regarding the reasoning underlying automated recommendations improved the accuracy of automation use, with no cost to decision time or subjective workload. Higher transparency in the form of projected decision outcome visualizations led to faster decisions, but less accurate automation use and an automation bias. Implications for the design of transparent interfaces to improve human-autonomy teaming outcomes in time-pressured environments are discussed.}

Compare musculoskeletal discomfort, productivity, postural risks, and perceived fatigue for a sit-stand-walk intervention between two workstation configurations – one, individually customized for office workers according to ergonomic guidelines (Ergo-Fit); another, self-adjusted by office workers according to their preference (Self-Adjusted).
Methods
36 participants performed a 60-min computer typing task in both configurations using a within-participants, counterbalanced design. Musculoskeletal discomfort and perceived fatigue were reported through surveys; productivity was operationalized by typing speed and typing error; postural risks were assessed by RULA for seated work, and REBA for standing work.
Results
Musculoskeletal discomfort and perceived fatigue did not vary significantly between configurations. Postural risks for seated and standing work were significantly lower for Ergo-Fit configuration; productivity was significantly higher for Self-Adjusted configuration.
Conclusion
Use of Ergo-Fit configuration for a sit-stand-walk intervention can facilitate postural transitions and increase physical activity, while enabling neutral postures in seated and standing work to minimize postural risks.}

The evidence of high reliability operations in organizations is key for validating that HRO is implementable and is also beneficial. After collecting over 1400 artifacts, we found 34 scholarly efforts published which purposefully targeted implementation measures toward achieving an HRO state and measured the outcomes. From that evidence, we concluded that three specific interventions have been used which were useful and generalizable to guide practitioners in moving toward an HRO state: process redesign, training, and organization redesign. We suggest that this evidence may assert that organizations which are not functioning as an HRO can be redesigned to do so.}

Using known acceleration inputs generated by an accelerometer calibrator and field collected vibration profiles simulating real-world vibration exposures, the measurements of an AMU device and GSA system were compared. Analysis of accelerometer calibrator data showed no significant difference in weighted acceleration (Aw) measurements between the systems (mean difference −0.001 m/s2, p = 0.95). In field collected vibration profile testing, differences in Aw measurements were small (0.06 m/s2, 4.6%).

Purpose
This study investigates the effects of the usage of a novel camera system compared to a conventional lens system for manual precision tasks. Utilizing the novel camera system aims to improve neck posture, reduce neck muscle tension and thereby minimize the risk of neck pain.
Methods
Camera and lens systems were compared by assessing the craniovertebral angle (CVA), electromyographic activity of the M.trapezius and perceived exertion. 16 healthy participants (n = 8 female, 24 ± 2 years; n = 8 male, 30 ± 5 years) performed manual precision tasks in a cross-over design using both systems in sitting and standing positions.
Results
Analyses showed that using the camera system improved the CVA in sitting [28.4° (22.8°–33.9°) to 42.5° (38.9°–46.1°); p < 0.01] and decreased the M.trapezius activity in standing [13.1% (7.7%–18.6%) to 8.65% (5.49%–11.81%)]. Additionally, overall and neck specific perceived exertion decreased when using the camera system in standing.
Conclusions
The camera system may prevent neck pain in workers performing manual precision tasks in sitting and standing postures.}

The trunk angles and postural sway parameters of twenty-five masonry workers were recorded for the following tasks: (1) standing on a simulated MCWP and laying bricks on an adjacent wall, and (2) stepping down onto the step deck to get into position for doing the bricklaying task. Results indicated that the use of the L-shaped production table resulted in the lowest trunk ranges of motion and significantly reduced the workers' trunk angles in all three planes when compared to both the straight-shaped production table and the conventional approach of not using a production table. Data showed that both body sway velocity and area were significantly reduced when using either one of the production tables. The use of production tables significantly reduced impact sway forces when workers stepped from the main platform to the step deck. The use of production tables on MCWPs improved workers’ postures and overall stability, which could reduce the risk of injury.}

Firstly, through literature studies and using an iterative design process a prototype seat-pan was designed and developed using spring-foam technology. The (dis)comfort of this seat was compared with a standard aircraft seat-pan. Twenty two participants were asked to sit in each seat for 90 min, completing a questionnaire every 15 min. At the end of each seating session pressure map recordings were made of the seat-pans. The results showed that the prototype seat-pan has on average a significantly higher comfort for the first 30 min and at a 60 min recording than the standard seat-pan. The discomfort and long term comfort were not significantly influenced. The pressure distribution on the prototype seat-pan was significantly closer to an ideal pressure distribution than a conventional seat-pan. In addition, the prototype seat-pan had a significantly larger contact area and lower average pressure. The seat-cushion weighs 20% less than the conventional seat-cushion. The study indicates that a seat-pan design using spring-foam technology can be lighter and more comfortable than conventional foam cushion materials. It is recommended to optimize the prototype seat further and conduct long term (dis)comfort studies with a broader variation in subjects’ age.}

abstract = {Training of surgeons is essential for safe and effective use of robotic surgery, yet current assessment tools for learning progression are limited. The objective of this study was to measure changes in trainees’ cognitive and behavioral states as they progressed in a robotic surgeon training curriculum at a medical institution. Seven surgical trainees in urology who had no formal robotic training experience participated in the simulation curriculum. They performed 12 robotic skills exercises with varying levels of difficulty repetitively in separate sessions. EEG (electroencephalogram) activity and eye movements were measured throughout to calculate three metrics: engagement index (indicator of task engagement), pupil diameter (indicator of mental workload) and gaze entropy (indicator of randomness in gaze pattern). Performance scores (completion of task goals) and mental workload ratings (NASA-Task Load Index) were collected after each exercise. Changes in performance scores between training sessions were calculated. Analysis of variance, repeated measures correlation, and machine learning classification were used to diagnose how cognitive and behavioral states associate with performance increases or decreases between sessions. The changes in performance were correlated with changes in engagement index (rrm=−.25,p<.001) and gaze entropy (rrm=−.37,p<.001). Changes in cognitive and behavioral states were able to predict training outcomes with 72.5% accuracy. Findings suggest that cognitive and behavioral metrics correlate with changes in performance between sessions. These measures can complement current feedback tools used by medical educators and learners for skills assessment in robotic surgery training.}

abstract = {Nursing is often hazardous work. Promoting safety and care requires nurses to apply knowledge, skill and creativity in patient encounters. Nurses' risk exposures are well documented, with research on student nurses' safety more limited. We studied final-year nursing students’ risk perceptions using questionnaire-based vignettes involving four patient presentations on patient aggression, manipulating patient and resource risk factors. We found student nurses were most likely to ask for help and wait when managing high-risk patient aggression scenarios. Student nurses placed most importance on their own safety and patient condition in making decisions. Resource risk significantly interacted with gender, with male nurses more likely to seek help when risks were high. There is need to improve student nurse training on managing patient aggression by promoting creative approaches to problem solving and critical thinking using simulation techniques to enhance situation awareness and translate knowledge to practice.}

Before conducting the experiment, the Human Machine Interfaces (HMI) were piloted with two sets of six participants (before and after iterations), to ensure the meaning of the displays can be understood by all. A static driving simulator experiment was conducted with a sample of 30 participants (between 18 and 55). Participants completed two pre-study questionnaires to evaluate previous driving experience, and attitude to trust in automation. During the study, participants completed a trust questionnaire after each simulated scenario to assess their trust level in the autonomous vehicle and HMI displays, and on intention to use and acceptance. The participants were shown 10 different driving scenarios that lasted approximately 2 minutes each. Results indicated that the ‘high visual feedback’ group recorded the highest trust ratings, with this difference significantly higher than for the ‘no visual feedback’ group (U = .000; p = <0.001 < α) and the ‘moderate visual feedback’ group (U = .000; p = <0.001 < α). There is an upward inclination of trust in all groups due to familiarity to both the interfaces and driving simulator over time. Participants' trust level was also influenced by the driving scenario, with trust reducing in all displays during safety verses non-safety-critical situations.}

abstract = {Aim
The aim of this study was to assess the work-related physical demands of long-distance truck drivers employed by a large gas delivery company in Canada.
Methods
A total of 15 truck drivers participated in a data collection that included self-reporting assessments, field observations, and direct measurements to describe daily tasks organization, postural demands, physical workload, and force exertions.
Results
Truck drivers' work was characterized by long working days ranging from 9.9 to 15.1 h (mean = 11.4 h), with half (49%) of the total working time spent behind the wheel. The overall workload as measured by relative cardiac strain (18.7% RHR) was found excessive for the long term given the shift duration. Peaks of heart rate in excess of 30 beats per minute above the daily average occurred mainly while operating valves and handling heavy hoses during gas deliveries. The task of delivering gas at a client's site required a moderate work rate on average (8.3 mlO2/kg/min) requiring 24.4% or maximum work capacity on average.
Conclusion
Based on multiple data sources, this study highlights the risks of over-exertion and of excessive physical fatigue in the truck drivers’ work that are coherent with the high prevalence of self-reported musculoskeletal pain in this group of workers.}

Musculoskeletal complaints in the neck, back, and wrists were reduced with training, but pain intensity was reduced only in the wrist region. A reduction in the occupational biomechanical exposure from the baseline to immediately post-training and 2 months after training both for novice and experienced workers was also observed. The novice workers group differed from the experienced workers by presenting a higher reduction of biomechanical exposure in the cutting room. All workers in this study benefited from the ergonomics educational training in the short and medium term. However, the success of training was highly dependent on the content and approach of the training.}

After applying selection criteria, reference searches, citation tracking and an in-depth reading, 28 studies were selected for review. Remarkably, the findings of these studies showed contrasting results. Both increases and decreases in job demands and controls were identified.

Motion sickness can be experienced in many domains, including car travel, on a boat, using virtual reality headsets and simulator use amongst others. It is expected that due to potential designs and use cases, self-driving cars will increase motion sickness onset likelihood and severity for many car travellers. Besides medication, there are limited methods through which one can actively reduce their motion sickness susceptibility. This research develops a novel visuospatial training tool and explores the effect of visuospatial training on motion sickness. With a combined sample of 42 participants split between driving simulator trials (n = 20), and on-road trials (n = 22) baseline visuospatial skills and motion sickness were first measured. After a 14-day training period where participates completed 15-min of pen and paper tasks per day, it was found that visuospatial skills improved by 40%. This increase in visuospatial ability was shown to be directly responsible for a reduction in motion sickness by 51% in the simulator (with a 60% reduction in participant dropouts) and a 58% reduction in the on-road trial. This research has successfully identified a new method to reduce motion sickness susceptibility and the impact of these findings have wide reaching implications for motion sickness research, especially in the field of self-driving vehicles.}

We spent 64 h in a gynecological operating unit conducting interviews with staff and observing device use during surgery. With qualitative analysis methods and based on existing usability principles, we created 21 design guidelines for the operating room context. The new guidelines highlight interactions between multiple devices, staff members, as well as other contextual factors. While the guidelines require further validation, they can potentially support the creation of more safe, ergonomic, and intuitive medical devices.}

Three empirical studies were conducted, involving a total of 92 drivers (with 44 in Study 1, 12 in Study 2, and 36 in Study 3) to explore user needs and requirements in an AV. In Study 1, safety and comfort, together with a variety of non-driving activities, were identified as the principal concerns about future autonomous vehicles. Based on these findings, Study 2 proposes a new rotatable seating position for AVs, with an in-vehicle information display to facilitate users' activities and situational awareness while driving. Study 3 consists of a series of laboratory simulator evaluation studies, and this indicated that drivers in the proposed design condition had better situational awareness in an AV when dealing with take-over situations. Such findings suggest the possibility of applying rear-facing seats in autonomous vehicles to support in-vehicle non-driving activities. Some specific implications of designs to enhance a driver's situational awareness have also been suggested.}

Donning sharps-proof clothing would permit bag-body contact, allowing the bag to be closer to the body, reducing biomechanical exposures. To test this hypothesis, 25 participants loaded waste bags into a simulated garbage truck hopper under two lifting (contact allowed, no contact) and bag mass (7 kg and 20 kg) conditions. Bottom-up rigid-link biomechanical modelling results including peak low back compression force, antero-posterior shear force and peak low back flexion angle were not different between the lifting conditions, but cumulative compression was decreased with bag-body contact, although only at the 20 kg mass. Bag mass had significant effects on outcome measures, causing compression to increase to 4663 (±697) N, exceeding recommended thresholds. Sharps-proof clothing and municipally mandated 23 kg maximum allowable bag mass restrictions may not sufficiently reduce biomechanical exposures to prevent MSD.}

Twenty participants attended an experiment where they were instructed to perform three types of basic touchscreen operation tasks in static, low vibration, and high vibration environments, respectively. Five GAINs (0.75, 1, 2, 3 and 4) and three operation precision requirements (90%, 95%, and 99%) were examined. The results indicated that vibration exerted adverse effects on task performance, and increased perceived workload, perceived task difficulty and discomfort. Task completion time showed a U-shaped curve as GAIN increased. Lowering operation precision requirement improved task performance and reduced perceived workload, especially in vibration environments and at larger GAINs. The findings provide practical implications on the design of usable touchscreen interfaces in vibration environments.}

This study investigated manual dexterity task performance of peg placement and shape delineation in seated, standing and suspended environments in 16 healthy controls and 26 professional rope-access trained individuals. Both seated and standing assessments were superior to those suspended, and height of suspension, total mass and years of experience had no influence on the task outcome.

We report a heuristic assessment of the new procedure against design guidelines and an evaluation in a full-flight simulator at the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) using qualified airline pilots to assess workload and performance. Both the manufacturer specified and new procedure were employed in three GA scenarios representative of increasing operational complexity. Results demonstrate an advantage for the new procedure design in the most complex scenario. The new, process-based procedure can reduce reported crew workload and improve response flexibility in more complex scenarios, improving rated performance. This study suggests that the process-based account in procedure design has advantages when compared to the flight crew-centric approach. These advantages include enhanced flexibility, robustness and improved crew performance during GA.}

In 2015, the U.S. federal government announced a $1.2 billion National Action Plan to combat resistance and reduce antibiotic use by 20% in inpatient settings and 50% in outpatient settings by 2020. We develop and apply a behavioral economics model based on game theory and “tragedy of the commons” concepts to help illustrate why rational individuals may not practice ideal stewardship and how to potentially structure three specific alternate approaches to accomplish these objectives (collective cooperative management, usage taxes, resistance penalties), based on Ostrom's economic governance principles. Importantly, while each approach can effectively incentivize ideal stewardship, the latter two do so with 10–30% lower utility to all providers. Encouraging local or state-level self-managed cooperative stewardship programs thus is preferred to national taxes and penalties, in contrast with current trends and with similar implications in other countries.}

Heart rate was significantly higher during active meeting. Results also indicated a significant effect of active meeting on stress. Well-being, focus and attention were similar during both meetings.

Dimensions present in the standards used did not match the majority of the sample. For sitting, seat width and depth individually presented the lowest levels of match, as well as under cumulative fit of all office furniture dimensions.

abstract = {Users frequently commit typing errors due to input language mode confusion (ILMC) when switching between multiple languages. This study evaluated two mode display cursors (MDCs) as a potential solution to ILMC: the monochrome and color-changing MDCs. Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the two MDCs in different dimensions of usability. Experiment 1 evaluated the effects of MDCs on ILMC and related typing errors and Experiment 2, on self-reported preference, acceptance and annoyance. In Experiment 1, 45 participants were divided into three groups, that each performed multi-language typing using an ordinary mouse cursor and the two MDCs. The color-changing MDC was found to significantly reduce ILMC and related typing errors compared to the ordinary mouse cursor (p < .001). In Experiment 2, 30 participants performed three typical computer tasks using both MDCs. The mean annoyance rating was significantly larger for the color-changing MDC than for the monochrome MDC (p = .037).}

Their introduction will therefore require systems that mitigate motion sickness. We investigated whether this can be achieved by augmenting the vehicle interior with additional visualizations. Participants were immersed in motion simulations on a moving-base driving simulator, where they were backward-facing passengers of an autonomous vehicle. Using a Head-Mounted Display, they were presented either with a regular view from inside the vehicle, or with augmented views that offered additional cues on the vehicle’s present motion or motion 500ms into the future, displayed on the vehicle’s interior panels. In contrast to the hypotheses and other recent studies, no difference was found between conditions. The absence of differences between conditions suggests a ceiling effect: providing a regular view may limit motion sickness, but presentation of additional visual information beyond this does not further reduce sickness.}

Ten nurses were recruited to perform three repositioning activities. Hand forces were recorded, and spine loading was estimated using a dynamic biomechanical model. Results demonstrated that except for the peak L5/S1 compressive load in the turning task, the use of assistive features significantly reduced the physical stresses for all repositioning activities. However, recommended thresholds for injury were still exceeded in many conditions. Compared with spinal load, hand force was much higher relative to the injury thresholds, suggesting a greater risk of shoulder and upper extremity injuries than low back injury. Mechanical lift equipment remains the safest and most robust way to reposition a patient.}

A survey within automotive assembly plants was conducted to capture RAPT operation data. After examining 80 total RAPT operations, we logged the 3D locations of the fastener location (with respect to the operator), direction and the hand placement location used by operators. Four common locations with respect to the midpoint between the ankle (in cm; X = sagittal plane, Y = transverse plane, Z = coronal plane): 1) 2, 113, 62; 2) 42, 104, 45; 3) -26, 151, 36; 4) -37, 92, 52.

Workplaces equipped with AR assistance-systems promise fast and accurate performance. Within the field of intralogistics, palletization constitutes a field of application which may benefit from guidance by AR. In the present investigation, participants performed a palletization task while they received instructions via three different devices (paper list, tablet, AR glasses). Performance data and subjective ratings were obtained. Participants subjectively preferred to work with the AR device. Number of errors was reduced while at the same time handling times were prolonged when the AR device was used. In all experimental conditions, performance improved in the course of the experiment. Least improvement was observed in the AR condition, which emphasizes that such applications allow decent performance without prior experience. Overall, the present results indicate that the utility of AR applications is limited when task demands are low. Such applications might be more useful in unclear and complex situations. Furthermore, AR possesses high hedonic qualities which may ease the integration of novel work processes.}

Fifteen subjects performed a submaximal cycling test twice, once with the headset, and once with a mouth mask and heartrate monitor. Concurrent validity of the headset was analyzed using an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Across all phases, a good correlation between the headset and mouth mask was observed for V̇O2, carbon dioxide production (V̇CO2) and exhaled volume (V̇E) (ICC≥0.72). The headset tended to underestimate V̇O2, V̇CO2 and V̇E at low intensities and to overestimate it at higher intensities. The headset was more valid for estimating V̇O2 (ICC = 0.39) than estimates based on heart rate (ICC = 0.11) (n = 7). Wind flow caused an overestimation (md ≥ 18.4 ± 16.9%) and lowered the correlation of V̇O2 between the headset and the mouth mask to a moderate level (ICC = 0.48). The subjects preferred the headset over the mouth mask because it was more comfortable, did not hinder communication and had lower breathing resistance. The headset appears to be useable for monitoring development of the energetic workloads of physically active workers, being more valid than heart rate monitoring and more practical than indirect calorimetry with a mouth mask. Proof-of-concept was confirmed. Another design step and further validation studies are needed before implementation in the workplace.}

The lifting time, maximum box tilt angle, muscular activity (brachioradialis, biceps brachii, deltoid, and erector spinae), maximum CoP velocity, and lifting difficulty were measured. The results showed that lifting time and maximum box tilt angle decreased with increasing handle height. Middle handle height (30 cm) resulted in the lowest muscular activity, maximum CoP velocity, and lifting difficulty. Low load's CoG height decreased lifting time, maximum box tilt angle, muscular activity, and lifting difficulty, however, it also increased maximum CoP velocity. In addition, high load increased lifting time, maximum box tilt angle, muscular activity, maximum CoP velocity, and lifting difficulty.}

In several countries, primary motorcycles with high displacement involve another purpose, namely motorcycling is a leisure activity. Motorcycles are used as tools of transport pleasure as opposed to being purely used for individual commuting purposes. The aim of the current study involves investigating the relation between experienced riding pleasure and riding behavior in a field test. Specifically, N = 12 motorcyclists between 21 and 66 years of age were observed while riding for approximately 8 h on public roads. The measurement setup included a logger for vehicle dynamics and vehicle handling data, GNSS data, video data, and subjective measures recorded as audio comments at predefined points of interest along the round course. A comprehensive dataset with more than 6000 km of motorcycling was gathered. The results indicate that parameters of lateral vehicle behavior, such as the maximum lean angle, reflected riding pleasure. Interestingly, this is applicable for curvy sections as well as straight roads. High ratings of riding pleasure correlated with riding in snaky lines as a type of self-stimulation on straight sections. Longitudinal vehicle dynamics, such as the range of accelerations, tend to increase with the riding pleasure in curves. Hence, the effects are smaller than those for lateral vehicle behavior and not visible on straight sections. Generally, curvy sections on rural roads produce higher pleasure than straight roads. On a global level, riding pleasure increases during the first few hours of riding and subsequently decreases with respect to the time on task. The results are discussed in the context of studies on driving pleasure from the automotive sector and more fundamental psychological theories that explain pleasure as a physiological stimulation or flow. Several individuals ride motorcycles to experience pleasure. A better understanding of rider behavior in these situations can aid in deriving proper assistance and to provide individual support to a rider, thereby increasing riding pleasure as well as safety.}

To determine whether time series models can accurately forecast individual response and for how many time periods ahead, five models were compared: naïve method, autoregression (AR), autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), vector autoregression (VAR), and the vector error correction model (VECM). For forecasts of three or more time periods ahead, the VECM model that incorporates historical RPE and wearable sensor data outperformed the other models with median mean absolute error (MAE) <1.24 and median MAE <1.22 across all participants for Lab Study 1 and Lab Study 2, respectively. These results suggest that wearable sensor data can support forecasting a worker’s condition and the forecasts obtained are as good as current state-of-the-art models using multiple sensors for current time prediction.}

However, head anthropometry studies using optical scanning rarely capture scalp shape because of hair interference. Data on scalp shape is available from bald men, but female data are generally not available. To address this issue, scalp shape was digitized in an ethnically diverse sample of 100 adult women, age 18–59, under a protocol that included whole head surface scanning and scalp measurement using a three-dimensional (3D) coordinate digitizer. A combined male and female sample was created by adding 3D surface scans of a similarly diverse sample of 80 bald men. A statistical head shape model was created by standardizing the head scan data. A total of 58 anatomical head landmarks and 12 head dimensions were obtained from each scan and processed along with the scans. A parametric model accounting for the variability of the head shape under the hair as a function of selected head dimensions was developed. The full-variable model has a mean shape error of 3.8 mm; the 95th percentile error was 7.4 mm, which were measured at the vertices. The model will be particularly useful for generating a series of representing a target population as well as for generating subject-specific head shapes along with predicted landmarks and dimensions. The model is publicly available online at http://humanshape.org/head/.}

Little focus has been given to mission-related aspects and how the command and control (C2) map display contributes to mission accomplishment. This study uses cognitive work analysis (CWA) to describe the operational work of the mission operator of a Skylark miniature UAS system. Three CWA phases were conducted – work domain analysis, control task analysis and strategy analysis – providing a rich framework of operational mission phases, task components, processes and the physical interface-objects in use. These representations highlight the operators' extensive use of the C2 map during all mission phases, for all object-related processes. To further enhance the outcomes of the CWA, and prior to outlining specific design requirements, an empirical investigation was conducted in which the eye movements of five experienced operators were obtained during a simulated mission. The empirical results confirm and further specify the work patterns that operators adopt. Quantitative analysis shows operators’ extensive focus on the map, especially during mission-critical phases. These analyses led to the conclusion that a significant change in the way operators interact with the C2 map, or alternative designs to enhance map-based information utilization, should be applied. Insights drawn from this analysis can be applied to other aerial surveillance work domains, and adding empirical evaluations is helpful to further refine and reinforce the CWA outcomes.}

Different instrument types corresponded to different reaction times – as response time increased, presentation time decreased. It can also be seen from the attention distribution of the instrument area in take-off that different instruments receive different attention resources. Breadth and attention span not only have a direct impact on the ability to read the table but also have a mediating effect on eye movement pattern during flight. The study found a direct relationship between attention span and instrument reading and also verified the impact of the two on attention allocation during take-off.

Due to the design of the precast/prestressed concrete product itself and the processes required for its production, employees are occasionally exposed to hazards. The industry recognizes this and devotes a significant amount of time and investment to mitigate these hazards and protect employees from harm. It is essential for employees to go through appropriate safety training before starting work in the plant. Practical safety training should be cost-effective, and performance guaranteed, and traditional training procedures include paper-based safety guidelines, lectures, videos, and on-site training. Virtual Reality (VR) provides an innovative approach for safety training as it could offer situational training with negligible risk and at a low cost. In this paper, a VR training module is developed to deliver safety training in a cost-effective yet repeatable manner, aiming to reduce common plant injuries. The module is developed using Unity3D and Visual Studio joint platforms and can be interfaced with using the Oculus Rift/Oculus S. The module addresses three major safety concerns in the plant: personal protective equipment (PPE), the tensioning of strand (the stressing process), and suspended loads. Efficacy and effectiveness analyses were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed VR module. The efficacy analysis was based on simulation sickness, user experience, and system usability. This analysis showed that the developed VR module is a user-friendly simulator with minimal simulation sickness. More than 50% of the participants reported no indications of simulation sickness. In addition, an effectiveness analysis was performed based upon a comparative study of this VR training method and the traditional video-based training method. This analysis indicated that VR training is more engaged and provides a better understanding of safety protocols and real-life experience of the precast/prestressed concrete plant.}

The purpose of this study was to investigate the usability of multiple vibrotactile feedback patterns in an entire virtual QWERTY keyboard input. A set of highly discriminable vibration patterns was designed and associated with different regions of a virtual keyboard to help users to locate the right keys. However, the number of stimulus patterns might also affect the typing performance. A user study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the multiple vibrotactile feedback. The results showed that an appropriate number of stimulus patterns provided higher typing speed, higher typing efficiency, and lower error rate.}

abstract = {Countdown timers (CDTs) for pedestrians and cars have been shown to produce various effects, including improved efficiency and decreased safety. This study aimed to explore adaptive behaviours of cyclists towards a CDT to green traffic light, conducted as a before-after study in real traffic. Cyclists adapted to the CDT by searching for and using the information that it provided, mainly in terms of speed adaptation and glance behaviour. Start-up delays were reduced but there is a concern that red light violations could increase. There might be undesirable effects on crucial information intake in cases where the CDT was used not as a complement but as a substitute for the traffic light. The results essentially indicate that cyclists use the information provided by the CDT for their own efficiency, rather than for rule-based safety.}

A 20 kg box was lifted from floor to chest height, and a 70 kg mannequin pulled across 20m. The effect of height, mass and average grip strength on kinematics and perceived workload was examined in 42 (19 females, 23 males) healthy individuals. A univariate linear regression analysis found females lifted with greater lumbar extension compared to males (p < 0.001), and adopted more hip (p = 0.006) and knee flexion (p = 0.036) in the pulling task. Females reported a greater perceived workload in both tasks (p < 0.001). After the multivariable analysis, only grip strength remained significant for perceived workload in the lift (p = 0.04), and height for knee flexion in the pull (p = 0.009). This highlights that height and strength are important factors driving kinematics and perceived workload. Clinicians may consider these factors in heavy manual tasks, more so than sex.}

Infra-red and thermal imaging enable wireless systems to monitor patients’ vital signs and absence of wires may improve patient experiences. No studies have explored staff perceptions of the concept of this specific type of technology in the adult population. Understanding existing working systems before introducing technology could improve adoption.
Methods
We conducted semi-structured interviews with Intensive Care Unit (ICU) staff exploring perceptions of wireless patient monitoring. We used the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) model to guide thematic analysis.
Results
We identified usability themes relating to staff perceptions of current patient monitoring experiences, staff perceptions of patient/relative expectations of ICU care, troubleshooting, hierarchy of monitoring, and consensus of trust.
Conclusion
The concept of wireless monitoring has perceived benefits for patients and staff. The Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety model guided a systems-based exploratory evaluation. Results highlight the social and environmental factors which may influence usability, adoption, or abandonment of wireless technology in the ICU.}

However, only a few studies have investigated the effect of training on highly automated driving. Moreover, available interactive trainings are mostly based on automated driving simulators and the application of immersive technology such as Virtual Reality (VR) as a low-cost training solution has not been widely adopted. In this study, we developed three types of familiarization tours (low-fidelity VR, high-fidelity VR, and video) to train first-time users of highly automated cars. Then, the effectiveness of these tours was investigated on automation trust and driving performance in several critical and non-critical transition tasks in four groups: control, video, low-fidelity VR, and high-fidelity VR. The results revealed the positive impact of the tours on trust and transition performance at the first time of measurement. Takeover quality only improved when practices were presented in high-fidelity VR. After three times of exposure to transition requests, trust and transition performance of all groups converged to those of the high-fidelity VR group, demonstrating that: a) experiencing takeover transition during the training may reduce costs associated with first critical takeover request in highly automated driving, b) the VR tour with high level of interaction fidelity was superior to other training methods, and c) untrained and less-trained drivers learned about automation after a few trials. Knowledge resulting from this research could help develop cost-effective solutions for automated driving training in dealerships and car rental centers.}

In our study, we measured the transmissibility and apparent mass at the mouth, lower back, and leg of participants during stationary and propelled walking. Stationary walking transmissibility was significantly higher at the lumbar spine and bite bar at 5 and 10 Hz compared to all higher frequencies while the distal tibia was lower at 5 Hz compared to 10 and 15 Hz. Propelled walking transmissibility was significantly higher at the bite bar and knee at 2 Hz than all higher frequencies. These results vary from previously published transmissibility values for static participants, showing that ISO standards should be adjusted for active workers.}

We generated walking simulations to estimate muscle and joint contact forces of unloaded walking and while carrying 38 kg using shoulder-borne backpacks and hip belt-assisted backpacks for six U.S. Marines. Three-dimensional peak and average lumbar (L4-L5) and hip joint contact forces over the stance phase were compared between each load condition. Axial L4-L5 and axial and anterior hip joint contact forces were greater during both backpack conditions compared to the unloaded condition.

Then, a kinematic gait analysis was completed in students walking unloaded or transporting 10%, 15% or 20% of their bodyweight (BW) in a backpack or trolley. RPE was recorded after each condition. The average hip rotation and knee adduction angles differed between body mass index (BMI) groups. The healthy-weight group reported higher RPEs than the overweight/obese group when pulling a trolley with 10–15% BW. In conclusion, both BMI groups responded similarly to load and schoolbag type.}

To identify requirements for human-in-the-loop simulation capabilities and improve their utility in predicting and optimizing soldier-systems integration.
Background
Technological development rates within the military are rapidly increasing. Emergent technologies often exclude in-depth consideration of human-system interactions until the physical prototyping phase. Human-in-the-loop simulation tools can allow for earlier consideration of humans in the development process; however, use remains limited.
Method
Semi-structured interviews were conducted with key informants to yield perspectives on current human-in-the-loop simulation capabilities and utility specific to the military. An inductive approach to thematic analysis was used to extract critical themes from transcribed interview data. A scoping review was completed to supplement the data obtained from interviews and summarize knowledge regarding requirements for human-in-the-loop simulation and analysis capabilities targeted to the military.
Results
Interviews were conducted with five experts representing the sectors of Vehicle/Equipment Design, Simulation, and Army Research. A total of 2274 sources were identified, and 64 papers were retained for the scoping review. Thematic analysis of the combined data sources yielded six important themes to consider with respect to requirements for future human-in-the-loop simulation capabilities targeting soldier-systems integration.
Conclusion
This study has identified eight key requirements to support the use of human-in-the-loop simulation tools to predict and optimize soldier-systems integration and performance.
Application
Addressing key requirements will improve the ability of current human-in-the-loop simulation tools to accommodate the military's need for human consideration early in the design process.}

abstract = {Falls on icy surfaces are the leading cause of occupational injuries for workers exposed to outdoor winter conditions. Slip resistant footwear has been shown to reduce the risk of falls for indoor workers but until recently, there was no accepted standard for evaluating the slip resistance of winter footwear on icy surfaces. Our team recently developed a lab-based testing protocol for measuring footwear slip resistance. This protocol, called the Maximum Achievable Angle (MAA) test, measures the steepest ice-covered slope that participants can walk up and down without experiencing a slip in a simulated winter environment. This lab-based protocol has found there is wide variability in the performance of commercially available winter footwear. In particular, we have found that a new generation of footwear that incorporates composite materials in the outsole, performs much better than most other footwear. The objective of this project was to investigate whether the footwear that performed well in our lab-based testing would reduce the risk of slips and/or falls in real-world winter conditions. One hundred and ten home healthcare workers from SE Health were recruited for this study and were asked to report their exposure to icy surfaces along with the numbers of slips and numbers of falls they experienced each week using online surveys over eight weeks in the winter. Fifty participants (the intervention group) were provided winter footwear that were among the best performing in the MAA test. The remaining sixty participants (the control group) wore their own footwear for the duration of the study. A total of 563 slips and 36 falls were reported over the eight-week data collection period. The intervention group consistently reported fewer slips (127 vs 436) and fewer falls (6 vs 30) compared to the control group. We found the slip rate in the intervention group was between 68.0% and 68.7% lower than the control group. Similarly, the fall rate was between 78.5% and 81.5% lower in the intervention group compared to the control group. These findings demonstrate that footwear that performs well in the MAA test can reduce the risk of both slips and falls in real-world winter conditions.}

We propose that (1) the ability to borrow adaptive capacity from other units is a hallmark of resilient systems and (2) the deliberate adjustment adaptive capacity sharing is a feature of some forms of resilience engineering. Some features of this domain that may lead to discovery of resilience and promote resilience engineering in other settings, notably hospital emergency rooms.}

abstract = {In real life, many objects catch our attention involuntarily or exogenously. Exogenous attention occurs fast and its effects are short-lived. In the laboratory, when attentional orientation is studied, both valid and invalid attentional signals are used: the valid ones direct the attention to a location where something relevant is going to appear. The invalid ones occur in a location where nothing relevant is going to happen. Usually, performance is improved when valid signals rather than invalid ones are presented. This work is novel in that it explores the effects of attentional capture and driving experience in situations of day-to-day driving while participants carry out a Hazard Prediction task. We created new Hazard Prediction (HPr) and Risk Estimation (RE) tests when driving by selecting 48 short videos recorded in a realistic way from the perspective of a car driver. We created valid and invalid trials by selecting videos in which a what?? was presented in the same spatial location as the one where the hazard was beginning to develop or in a different location. Simple situations, with only one developing hazard, were also presented. A total of 92 participants (30 experienced drivers, 32 novices and 30 with no experience) were placed in the position of the driver and answered the questions: 1) What will happen after the video is cut? 2) To what extent do you consider this situation risky? The results from the Hazard Prediction test replicate the attentional capture effect in complex driving situations, with invalid trials obtaining the worst results, followed by valid and simple ones. Participants with experience obtained better scores than novices, and novices were better than drivers without experience. No interaction between attentional orientation and experience was found, suggesting the obligatory and automatic nature of orientation processes, which do not appear to be compensated for by driving experience. No significant differences were found for the Risk Estimation test.}

To this end, we carried out a simulated outbreak alert, to place two experts in a situation of epidemiological problem management, based on usual practice but also conducive to implementing creative solutions. To analyze the data, we considered not only the relevance of the solutions proposed by the experts, but also the four creativity criteria defined by Torrance (fluency, flexibility, elaboration and originality). Results allowed us to identify similarities but also differences between the solutions proposed by the experts, depending on their level of experience in this area.}

There are several contributory risk factors having impact on the development of MSDs. This study aimed to (1) explore midwives' experiences and views about work-related MSDs and contributing risk factors, and (2) analyse working postures for musculoskeletal injury risks. A mixed method approach was used with interviews/focus group (n = 15/7) and observations (n = 22) of specific tasks (during birth and after birth) using the posture analysis observational method (Rapid Entire Body Assessment, REBA). The participants were midwives who had an active role in the United Kingdom (UK) National Health Services (NHS). It was found that MSDs were often attributed to the physical (working in awkward positions), organisational (longer shift hours, fewer staff, increased work load), psychosocial (defensive practice, higher demand) challenges of midwifery. All postures had very high to medium REBA risk levels with action categories indicating that action or further assessment is definitely necessary to reduce MSDs. This research provides a holistic approach by analysing risk factors and interactions in the work context to inform the development of risk management strategies. Midwifery working conditions have a big impact on developing musculoskeletal symptoms. Management of such symptoms will improve staff wellbeing, mother and baby safety, individuals' life trajectories and staff shortages.}
