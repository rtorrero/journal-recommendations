abstract = {Purpose
To assess differences in spinal, pelvic and lower limb parameters in healthy individuals during a stand-to-sit task using three different seating conditions.
Methods
Ten healthy adults carried out three stand-to-sit movements on different stools: a high ergonomic stool with the seat tilted 10° forward; a standard stool (adjusted to the same height as the ergonomic stool) and a standard stool at a lower level (so their thighs were horizontal). Movements were recorded by an optoelectronic Vicon system.
Results
Hip flexion was altered by the height of the seat (significantly greater for the low standard stool in comparison to either the ergonomic stool or the high standard stool (p < 0.0001)). There was also significantly less knee flexion with the ergonomic stool in comparison to the low standard stool (p < 0.0001) and to the high standard stool (p = 0.0017). Lumbar lordosis was not significantly altered by seat height, although it was less pronounced with the ergonomic stool, with a significantly higher range of motion for the pelvis (p = 0.015). At the thoracic level, no differences were observed, except that the stand-to-sit movement on the lower stool produced greater flexion.
Conclusion
Lumbar lordosis was not increased by the ergonomic stool and the range of lower limb motion was reduced by the high seat. These findings contrast with current opinion that ergonomic seats promote lumbar lordosis.}

The aims of this study were to identify the processes that underpin nursing teamwork and how these affect the care of older people, identify the relationship between perceived teamwork and perceived quality of care, and explore in depth the experience of working in nursing teams. The study was carried out in three older people's wards in a London teaching hospital. Nurses and healthcare assistants completed questionnaires (n = 65) on known dynamics of teamwork (using the Nursing Teamwork Survey) together with ratings of organisational quality (using an adapted AHRQ HSPS scale). A sample (n = 22; 34%) was then interviewed about their perceptions of care, teamwork and how good outcomes are delivered in everyday work. Results showed that many care difficulties were routinely encountered, and confirmed the importance of teamwork (e.g. shared mental models of tasks and team roles and responsibilities, supported by leadership) in adapting to challenges. Perceived quality of teamwork was positively related to perceived quality of care. Work system variability and the external environment influenced teamwork, and confirmed the importance of team adaptive capacity. The CARE model shows the centrality of teamwork in adapting to variable demand and capacity to deliver care processes, and the influence of broader system factors on teamworking.}

abstract = {Background
The prolonged standing position is an important factor in the onset of foot musculoskeletal disorders among workers. Safety shoes, designed to protect against the physical constraints of the work environment, do not address this issue to date.
Objectives
The goal of this study is to assess the possible benefits of custom-made foot orthoses among prolonged standing workers.
Study design
repeated measures without control group.
Methods
Thirty-four standing workers who suffer from foot pain volunteered for the study. Custom-made foot orthoses, designed by a podiatrist, were 3D-printed and distributed to each volunteer. Static balance as well as static and dynamic plantar pressure measurements were carried out with sensors inserted in the safety shoes, before and after three weeks of wearing foot orthoses daily. A questionnaire on pain and comfort was also distributed before and after treatment.
Results
Feelings of pain, discomfort and heavy legs were found to be significantly reduced after wearing 3D-printed orthoses (p<0.05). Additionally, in static and dynamic conditions, a significant decrease in mean peak pressure in the rearfoot area was observed along with a significant increase in mean peak pressure in the midfoot area (p<0.05). There was also a significant improvement of balance in the medial-lateral direction.
Conclusion
Custom-made orthoses significantly increase the well-being of standing workers in our experimental testing conditions. The custom-made shape allows for a better balanced distribution of foot peak pressure thanks to its support and stimulation of the foot arches particularly through a shift of pressure from the heel to the midfoot.}

To test this, an in-flight experiment was performed, in which forty non-pilots rolled wings level after receiving motion cues. A No-leans condition (subthreshold motion to a bank angle) was included, as well as a Leans-opposite condition (leans cues, opposite to the bank angle) and a Leans-level condition (leans cues, but level flight). The presence of leans cues led to an increase of the roll reversal error (RRE) rate by a factor of 2.6. There was no significant difference between the Leans-opposite and Leans-level condition. This suggests that the expectation strongly affects the occurrence of an RRE, and that people tend to base their responses on motion cues instead of on information on the AI. We conclude that expectation and spatial disorientation have a large effect on piloting errors and may cause hazardous aircraft upsets.}

This paper outlines an approach to develop practical guidelines to support the design of submarine control console workstations.
Method
Guideline development was undertaken for 13 physical design criteria, provided to the research team. Data was gathered from four sources: a systematic literature review, relevant standards, population specific anthropometric data, and user focus groups. The systematic review included risk of bias, quality assessment and evidence synthesis.
Results & Conclusion
The systematic review retrieved 43 relevant articles in relation to seven of the 13 design criteria. Very few high-quality studies were identified. The combined evidence available from each of the four data sources was collated and used to provide a set of guidelines for each of the 13 criteria, highlighting the importance of the use of multiple data sources. This approach has applicability beyond this study where the need exists to collate evidence sources beyond the scientific literature.}

Data from 13,540 full-time employees interviewed in the 2015 BAuA-Working Time Survey was used. By means of latent class analysis, we extracted six types of work schedules. Subjective health was highest in the flexible extended and flexible standard schedules, both featuring high working time control. Work-life balance was highest in the flexible standard and rigid standard schedules and lowest in schedules with high working time demands, namely the extended shift, rigid all-week, and rigid extended schedules. Employees with high working time demands and low control represent risk groups prone to impairments of well-being. Overall, this study offers an intuitive taxonomy for the design of sustainable work schedules.}

This study investigated the impact of progressive shoe wear on the available coefficient of friction (ACOF) and under-shoe fluid dynamics. Five different slip-resistant shoes were progressively worn using an accelerated, abrasive, wear protocol. The ACOF and fluid forces (the load supported by the fluid) were measured as shoes were slipped across a surface contaminated with a diluted glycerol solution. As the shoes became worn, an initial increase in ACOF was followed by a steady decrease. Low fluid forces were observed prior to wear followed by increased fluid forces as the worn region became larger. Results suggest that traction performance decreases particularly when the heel region without tread exceeds a size of 800 mm2. This study supports the concept of developing shoe replacement guidelines based upon the size of the worn region to reduce occupational slips.}

Monitoring accuracy was better for participants using spearcons and a HWD (88.7%) or a HWD alone (86.2%) than for participants using spearcons alone (74.1%). Participants using the spearcons and HWD (37.7%) performed the tracking task no differently from participants using spearcons alone (37.1%) but participants using the HWD alone performed worse overall (33.1%).

Participants in the control group (n = 62) were training to use the traditional text-based ATM interface meanwhile those in the experimental group (n = 62) were training to use the alternative ATM interface with graphical icons. They were asked to learn how to perform three major tasks of ATMs. A test immediately following the training and a test one month after training was carried out. Task completion score was used for measuring user performance. The results showed although training could help elderly novice users succeed in learning to use ATMs, they still had a significant decline in user performance in the test one month later compared with the immediate test. Participants of the experimental group outperformed those of the control group in both the immediate test and one month test after training, especially in the latter. The finding suggested graphical icons could help to improve the learning and retention of ATM usage for elderly novice users, especially the latter, which would compensate for the drawback of training and reduce forgetting rate to some extent. Well-designed graphical icons could benefit elderly novice users much from learning phase to retention phase. The findings of this study can be applied to guide the design and development of ATMs or other public technology devices considering elderly novice users.}

Overall 24% of the roadside advertising signs were fixated. Fixation rate was significantly influenced by sign category, clearance from the road and number of characters. Median value for fixation duration was 297 ms. Fixation duration was significantly influenced by speed, elevation from road level, number of medium size characters, and was higher in the rural context. Median value for fixation distance was 58.10 m, and was significantly influenced by advertising sign category, character count and speed.}

The joint angles, when using a touch screen, were measured to calculate the joint torque ratios (JTRs). Subjective screen visibility were also determined. The optimal installation position was determined by solving a bi-objective optimization problem consisting of two objective functions. The Pareto optimal solutions for the two objectives showed a range of 1124–1251 mm and 44.4–67.9°. The proposed method determined the optimal installation position of the touch screens.}

One common concept for an automated vehicle is to have both forward and rearward facing seats. However, traveling backwards could lead to an increased likelihood of experiencing motion sickness due to the inability of occupants to anticipate the future motion trajectory. This study aimed to empirically evaluate the impact of seating orientation on the levels of motion sickness within an AV cabin. To this end, a vehicle was modified to replicate the common concept of automated vehicles with forward and rearward facing seats. Two routes were chosen to simulate motorway and urban driving. The participants were instructed to carry out typical office tasks whilst being driven in the vehicle which consisted of conducting a meeting, operating a personal device and taking notes. The participants conducted the test twice to experience both forward and rearward seating orientations in a randomised crossover design. Levels of sickness reported was relatively low with a significant increase in the mean level of sickness recorded when traveling rearwards. As expected, this increase was particularly pronounced under urban driving conditions. It is concluded that rearward travel in automated vehicles will compromise the passenger experience.}

abstract = {The Visual Field (VF) principle has been found to apply in many situations, but has not been tested under many possible conditions of operator posture with different display and control locations. In this research we used four display locations, four control locations relative to a seated operator and tested the strength of population stereotype for six different types of controls with linear displays moving either horizontally or vertically and circular displays with a neutral indicator at the 12, 3, 6 and 9 o'clock positions. Apart from several minor differences in operator responses, the VF principle held up well under all these different display/control relationships. By designing the display/control arrangement to have high stereotype strength, the direction of control movement for a given direction of indicator movement can be selected to comply with the VF principle for producing fewest errors in movement direction.}

The design and usability of the evaluated websites were not satisfactory from the users’ perspectives. Multivariate regression models indicated that Web layout and performance were the main predictors of website usability, while personal characteristics including gender, age and Web usage experience of users had no effect. User satisfaction was also influenced only by the Web design attributes (particularly Web structure) and not by the personal characteristics of the users. There was also a significant relationship between website usability and user satisfaction. The findings suggest that the website designers should focus more on the Web design attributes (particularly Web layout and structure), regardless of the personal characteristics of their users, to improve the usability and user satisfaction of websites.}

To provide basis for product design and enhance user performance and safety, a usability and performance assessment of modern riding lawn-mowing tractor designs and features was conducted in a real-world test environment. Five current commercially available RLEs were tested with response measures including task performance time and accuracy, physiological workload, system usability scores (SUS), and subjective rankings of RLE models. This data was used to identify sensitivity of responses to variations in RLE design features and functionality. The data was also used to assess the validity of new tractor design standard conformance tool, the RLEval methodology. This tool made comprehensive evaluation of RLE models compliance with over 70 specific design standards and was applied by human factors experts. Experiment results revealed sensitivity of all response measures to design differences among the five RLE models, except the objective workload measures. Response measures including task performance, SUSs and subjective rankings showed partial agreement with the RLEval scores. In general, the study results demonstrated a comprehensive experimental methodology for usability and performance evaluations of RLEs as well as merit of using the RLEval as preliminary method to compare design features. Some aspects of the usability experimentation and the RLEval method appear to be complementary.}

WARD use improved operator trackkeeping performance, the practice of good seamanship, and SA, although operator responsiveness decreased. WARD users who used more closed-loop communication and information sharing showed improved threat avoidance, suggesting that operators can avoid accidents and failure through WARD use that promotes sharing and confirming information. WARD use also promoted information source diversity, a means of developing requisite variety. These operational impacts are important in safety-critical settings where failures can be catastrophic.}

Discomfort increased significantly across all body areas with knee and ankle discomfort greater (in a clinically meaningful manner) in under-desk cycling. Sustained attention reaction time was the only cognitive measure to show a difference between conditions (slower for under-desk cycling [β-34.82 CI (−62.12 to −7.53)]). There was no evidence of muscle fatigue, while kinematic differences between conditions were identified. Mental state deteriorated over time in both conditions.

The second company of the Spanish Army Attack Helicopter Battalion (n = 15) performed three sets of standardized flight exercises with different levels of complexity (low [recognition flights], medium and high [emergency flights]). Throughout the flight exercises we recorded pilots' gaze entropy, as well as pilots' performance (assessed by an expert flight instructor) and subjective ratings of task load (assessed by the NASA-Task Load Index). Furthermore, we used pilots' electroencephalographic (EEG) activity as a reference physiological index for task load variations. We found that pilots’ gaze entropy decreased ∼2% (i.e., visual scanning became less erratic) while solving the emergency flight exercises, showing a significant decreasing trend with increasing complexity (p < .05). This is in consonance with the ∼12% increase in the frontal theta band of their EEG spectra during said exercises. Pilots' errors and subjective ratings of task load increased as flight complexity increased (p-values < .05). Gaze data suggest that pilots used nondeterministic visual patterns when the aircraft was in an error-free state (low complexity), and changed their scanning behavior, becoming more deterministic, once emergencies occurred (medium/high complexity). Overall, our findings indicate that gaze entropy can serve as a sensitive index of task load in aviation settings.}

There is a high rate of injury associated with firefighting: in 2016, 21% of all fireground injuries were attributed to falls, jumps and slips. Examining factors related to balance, including experience in wearing firefighter gear, may assist in reducing injury related to falls.
Objectives
To assess the effects of wearing firefighter gear on postural balance in firefighters and non-firefighters in a rested condition.
Methods
Each subject attended two sessions. In session 1, informed consent was obtained, a threshold audiogram was collected, and the sensory organization test (SOT) and motor control test (MCT) were administered with the subject dressed in street clothes. The second session was comprised of three different conditions with the order of testing randomized across subjects: street clothing, firefighter protective garments (coat, pants, helmet, hood) with breathing apparatus but no facemask, and firefighter protective garments with breathing apparatus and facemask. Twenty subjects participated: ten firefighters (8 males) and sex and age-matched non-firefighters (8 males) completed the study.
Results
SOT scores were obtained for each sub-condition, including the overall performance score and sensory weightings. For the MCT, latency and amplitude data were obtained for the three forward and three reverse translation conditions. A significant difference was found for large forward surface translations in the MCT in firefighters.
Conclusion
In spite of the altered center of balance created by breathing apparatus and the altered visual cues created by the facemask, wearing firefighter gear did not substantively affect anterior-posterior postural stability or motor response to linear translation in rested, healthy individuals. Firefighters and non-firefighters performed similarly across all except one of the experimental conditions.}

This study sought to investigate how diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), a common complication of diabetes characterized by reduced sensitivity of the limbs, can influence people's braking behavior and other safety-related measures of driving. In addition, it also tested how such a deteriorating effect can be reduced by using certain pedal layout designs. In total, 29 healthy drivers and 31 drivers of type 2 diabetes matched in demographic variables were invited to participate in this study. The participants with type 2 diabetes (they are from here on out referred to as “patients")were then split into two subgroups based on the severity of DPN using the median of the Semmes–Weinstein monofilaments Examination (SWME) scores. All three groups of participants finished a series of vehicle-pedestrian conflict tasks in a driving simulator using nine different types of pedal layouts. These layouts varied in the lateral distance between the accelerator and the brake (45 mm, 60 mm, and 75 mm) and the width of brake pedals (50 mm, 70 mm, 90 mm). The results showed that patients with serious DPN had longer brake reaction times (BRT) and shorter minimum distance-to-collision (DTC) as compared to the other two groups. However, the effects of such a disadvantage varied across different pedal layouts. When the accelerator-brake distance was 45 mm, patients with serious DPN showed no compromised driving performance as compared to other two groups. In conclusion, we found the DPN could undermine driving performance of participants with type 2 diabetes, and a closer accelerator-brake lateral distance (45 mm) may be an optimal choice for them to counteract such a negative influence.}

The four curvatures (flat, horizontally convex, vertically concave, and horizontally concave) each demonstrated both beneficial and detrimental effects; however, hand size effects were non-significant across all usability measures. No single fixed display curvature was found to be beneficial across all considered smartphone usability measures, indicating multiple curvatures (e.g. combinations of flat and vertically concave curvatures) are required from a single smartphone model rather than a single fixed curvature to improve an overall smartphone usability. Such varying curvatures are feasible with bendable displays. Comprehensive usability evaluations, especially focusing on grip comfort and image distortion, are needed when applying display curvatures on small devices.}

The variables obtained were the degrees of flexion/extension, adduction/abduction and internal/external rotation of the thorax, pelvis, hip, knee and ankle. Statistical parametric mapping was used to evaluate differences between conditions and loads throughout the gait cycle. In the backpack conditions, the magnitudes of the differences decreased from proximal to distal joints compared to the unloaded condition. The use of a school trolley only required minor kinematic adaptations. Therefore, from kinematic analysis, it is recommended to avoid loads above 10% BW for children using a backpack and below 20% BW for children using a trolley.}

It is therefore becoming increasingly important to identify systemic aspects that can address some of these Human Factors challenges. This paper applies the principles of the Risk Management Framework to explore the wider systemic issues associated with automated driving in the United Kingdom through the novel application of network metrics. The authors propose a number of recommendations targeted at each level of the Risk Management Framework that seek to shift the power of influence away from vehicle manufacturers and back into the hands of governing bodies.}

Nasal skin temperature might be a valid index to track physiological variations due to reduced arousal levels, and its use could prevent a drowsiness-related deterioration of performance. However, the few studies that have investigated nasal skin temperature in applied settings have had inconsistent results. Here, we assessed the validity of nasal skin temperature to monitor changes in arousal levels (from alertness to drowsiness). The participants performed a 2-h simulated driving task while we simultaneously recorded their nasal skin temperature, brain activity (we used frontal delta electroencephalographic [EEG] activity as the reference index of alertness), and driving performance (speeding time). For those variables, we calculated growth curve models. We also collected subjective ratings of alertness and fatigue before and after the driving session. We found that the nasal skin temperature showed a cubic trajectory (it increased for the first 75 min, and then it began to decrease, but such deceleration gradually diminished over time). As expected, frontal delta EEG activity showed an inverted U-shaped quadratic trend (EEG power increased for the first hour and half, and gradually decreased during the last thirty minutes). The speeding time exhibited a similar pattern of change. Subjective sleepiness and fatigue increased after the task. Overall, our results suggest that nasal skin temperature seems to be a valid measure of arousal variations while performing a complex and dynamic everyday task.}

Subjects indicated they expect to experience more comfort with a headrest when watching IFE for a duration of two movies during a long-haul flight. This study also found a significant difference in posture. In the condition without headrest the head was more upright compared to the condition with headrest. The lack of significant difference in muscle activity and the significant difference in posture may indicate that humans tend to look for a head position that is neutral, in the sense of minimal muscle effort. This study shows that the use of a headrest may benefit the comfort experience of the passenger during flight.

The aim of the current studies was to use multiple command teams to empirically examine a novel submarine control room configuration and a reduced crew size in comparison to a baseline of contemporary operations to see if such bottlenecks could be removed. Ten teams performed high and low demand Dived Tracking (DT) scenarios in a simulated submarine control room. Activities and communications of the teams were recorded and quantified using the Event Analysis of Systemic Teamwork (EAST) method affording statistical comparisons with a baseline condition of contemporary operations. The findings showed that the co-location of operators relieved the bottleneck of communications between the SOC and the OPSO. Although overall communications increased, this was more balanced across the team and was more adaptive to scenario demand. This was coupled with a significant increase in task completion, even with a reduced crew size, suggesting greater efficiency and productivity. Future research should seek to validate the changes observed with objective measures of task performance.}

abstract = {Smartphones have become a common tool of daily communication, and a number of text input methods are extensively used. Qwerty and T9 are two universally used smartphone input methods that differ in user experience (UX) when entering phrases with different complexity. Phrase complexity is an indication of the number and type of characters used in a phrase. This study evaluated the impact of both experience and phrase complexity on the UX of Qwerty and T9. Thirty-two participants with different experience levels (high and low) used both Qwerty or T9 to input 40 phrases (both simple and complex phrases). Input time, speed, error rate, galvanic skin response, heart rate, and perceived usability were analyzed as dependent variables. The results indicated that Qwerty was more effective than T9 for entering complex phrases, while no obvious difference was found for simple phrases. Experience had a positive impact on the input method, and Qwerty was more helpful for participants with low experience level. Performance, physiological reaction, and perceived usability data showed similar results. These findings aid the optimal design of text input systems for smartphones.}

This study applies an Inclusive Design approach to a community-based back pain service to understand the challenges, in relation to patients' capabilities, that can affect their access to the service. It consisted of three steps: i) online surveys and interviews with physiotherapists and collected patients' personal online care stories to gather insight into their experiences within the back pain care journeys; ii) estimated services' demands made on patients when they access the service and identified the related challenges and iii) proposed recommendations that could address the challenges for patients to access the service. The study suggests an Inclusive Design approach could help identify capability-related challenges such as vision and memory which could affect people's access to back pain treatment. In addition, the application of the approach also uncovered some non-capability-related challenges.}

Current approaches towards environmentally sustainable design are primarily focused on capturing the environmentally conscious and pro-environmental consumers, or changing the attitude and behaviour of the anti-environmental consumer. In a survey of 521 consumers, environmental attitude was a poor predictor of environmental behaviour. A series of interviews was performed with different profiles of environmentally orientated users to assess their environmental attitudes and behaviour. The survey and interview data were used to develop four personas, one for each of the environmental attitude and behaviour types based on data from the consumer survey. A case study performed with university design students found that concepts generated by groups using environmentally orientated personas scored higher on environmental sustainability versus those generated by groups using an image board. This study illustrates how user-centred design approaches could be used to embed sustainable design in products by exploiting consumer environmental behaviour to overcome different attitudes and behaviour.}

Seventy-two student participants had to indicate the presence (or absence) of a threat item (either a gun or a knife) in a series of grey-scaled X-ray images of cabin baggage. Three work-rest schedules were examined: spontaneous breaks (i.e. participants could take breaks at any time), two 5-min breaks and two 10-min breaks during a 1-h testing session. Furthermore, half of the participants were assisted in their task by an adaptable support system offering three levels of automation: (1) no support, (2) cues indicating the presence of a potential threat item, and (3) cues indicating the exact location of a potential threat item. Results showed no performance differences between break regimes, which suggests that there may be viable alternatives to the current EU regulations. It also emerged that providing participants with adaptable automation did not lead to better detection performance but resulted in a less positive response bias than participants without automatic support. Implications for current aviation security regulations are discussed.}

To objectively determine sit-stand workstation usage and what impact computer-based prompts would have on sit-stand desk use and sustainability, 200 office workers (118 control and 82 treatment) in two different geographic locations were continuously monitored over a 4 ½ month period, which consisted of a 6-week baseline and a 3-month experimental period. During the 3-month experimental period, computer-based prompts elicited a 229% increase in daily standing transitions which was sustained over the entire 3 months with 40% of the participants adhering to a pre-determined sit to stand schedule. These findings indicate that the use of computer-based prompts can be used to motivate employees to change their behavior regarding the use of sit-to-stand workstations.}

In this paper, we evaluate the effects of age and obesity on trunk muscle activity of six trunk muscle pairs during one-handed carrying of different loads. The results suggest that older and obese individuals do not exhibit considerably larger muscle activity than young and non-obese individuals while carrying a load of approximately 10 kg in one hand for relatively short distances. Accordingly, 10 kg appears to be an acceptable load to be occasionally carried in one hand by older and/or obese individuals from a muscle activity perspective.}

A Phantom 4 quadcopter was remotely controlled to hover at one of the 32 pre-determined locations in the air. Thirty-two participants on the ground were requested to judge if they could see the quadcopter on a four-point scale: 1. definitely yes, 2. probably yes, 3. probably no, and 4. definitely no. The participants also responded whether they could hear the quadcopter on the same four-point scale. Logistic regression models were established to estimate the probability of detecting the quadcopter in the air, both visually and auditory. When navigating a quadcopter flying away from the operator, the sound stimulus diminished and then disappeared earlier than that of the sight of the quadcopter. The results of the study indicated that the probability of visual detection of the quadcopter at a distance of 300 m was approximately 0.3. When adopting a 50% probability of visual detection and the “definitely or probably yes” criterion, the estimated distance of line-of-sight was 245 m. The corresponding visual angle was 0.065°. The information in this study is valuable for drone operators, operator training institutes, and drone designers. The aviation authorities may also consider revising the codes or regulations for small UAV operation based on our findings.}

In manufacturing plants, the ergonomic assessment of adopted working postures is indispensable to avoid risk factors of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. This process receives high research interest and requires extracting plausible postural information as a preliminary step. This paper presents a semi-automated end-to-end ergonomic assessment system of adopted working postures. The proposed system analyzes the human posture holistically, does not rely on any attached markers, uses low cost depth technologies and leverages the state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. In particular, we train a deep convolutional neural network to analyze the articulated posture and predict body joint angles from a single depth image. The proposed method relies on learning from synthetic training images to allow simulating several physical tasks, different body shapes and rendering parameters and obtaining a highly generalizable model. The corresponding ground truth joint angles have been generated using a novel inverse kinematics modeling stage. We validated the proposed system in real environments and achieved a joint angle mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.19±1.57∘ and a rapid upper limb assessment (RULA) grand score prediction accuracy of 89% with Kappa index of 0.71 which means substantial agreement with reference scores. This work facilities evaluating several ergonomic assessment metrics as it provides direct access to necessary postural information overcoming the need for computationally expensive post-processing operations.}

The charts showed frequent changes in the nature of observed activities, with interleaved multitasking a constant feature and external prompts often clustered in time. Evidence of seniority-related differences in work were apparent with consultants switching between more concurrent patients and receiving more frequent clinical prompts than junior physicians, illustrating their overseeing and advice-giving role. The ubiquity of interleaved multitasking suggests a need to focus on developing individual strategies to support frequent cognitive switching. Work that appears fragmented at physician level may form part of a flexible and robust system, rather than an error-prone set of isolated individual behaviours.}

The purpose of this study was to investigate the accumulation of fatigue over a two-week offshore period. In particular, the effects of (1) time-of-day and days-on-shift as well as (2) acute and chronic sleep loss on the rate at which fatigue accumulates were investigated.
Methods
42 day-shift offshore workers were examined. Fatigue was measured using pre- and post-shift scores on the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). Total sleep time was measured using actigraphy (Motionwatch8, Camntech). Data was analyzed using a linear mixed model analyses.
Results
Average sleep loss per night was 92 min (95%CI: 89.6–94.0; p < .001). Mean cumulative sleep loss across the study was 21:20hrs (SD = 08:10hrs) over the 14 days. Chronic sleep loss was significantly related to a modest increase in sleepiness (KSS) across the shift (95%CI: 0.01–0.17; p = .020) and in post-shift scores (95%CI:.07–0.19; p < .001). Time-of-day (95%CI: 0.63 to −0.01; p = .042) and days-on-shift (95%CI: 0.03–0.08; p < .001) as well as their interaction (95%CI: 0.08 to −0.00; p = .027) influenced the rate at which fatigue accumulated over a two-week offshore period.
Conclusions
Pre- and post-shift fatigue accumulate in different ways over the two-week offshore period. The accumulation of post-shift fatigue scores was positively related to successive days-on-shift and chronic sleep loss. Our results suggest that prolonging offshore periods will likely result in elevated fatigue risk. Accumulating fatigue and sleep loss over two-week offshore periods should be considered in fatigue risk management plans and systems.}

A reflexive practice method was used to describe strategies implemented during a multi-site research project focusing on musculoskeletal disorders prevention in the meat processing sector. A 3 levels commitment method was developed which included: each subcontractor individually, subcontractors together, and subcontractors with their main contractor. Four strategies from the literature were firstly implemented: the creation of a steering committee, the identification of tendencies to act, the transfer of knowledge and moderation of collective discussion. An additional new strategy based on the sharing of a common interest – knife sharpening and maintenance was necessary to achieve the commitment. These results reinforce the importance of stakeholder strategies commitment in PE. A greater consideration for developing a valid framework is needed.}

At a fixed pace, participants (n = 12) repeated “drilling” two same-sized holes for 2 min. A fairly consistent result across exoskeleton designs was that higher precision demands increased some muscle activation levels and deteriorated quality. Designs with supernumerary arms led to the largest reductions in quality and increased physical demands overall, mainly in the low back. The shoulder-focused exoskeleton reduced shoulder demands but appeared to reduce quality with the highest precision requirement. Although future work is needed under more diverse/realistic scenarios, these results might be useful to (re)design occupational exoskeletons.}

It is also known that a greater ability to predict danger is related to a lower probability of suffering accidents. It could be hypothesised that drivers with a higher tendency to distraction are worse at predicting traffic hazards, but to what extent might driving experience serve to mitigate this tendency to distraction? The current study collected self-reported attentional errors from drivers by using the Attention-Related Driving Errors Scale (ARDES-Spain) in order to examine whether novice drivers suffered from inattention more than experienced drivers. The results demonstrated that novice drivers scored more highly on ARDES than experienced drivers. ARDES scores were then related to performance in a Hazard Prediction test, where participants had to report what hazard was about to happen in a series of video clips that occlude just as the hazard begins to develop. While experienced drivers were better at the Hazard Prediction test than novice drivers, those participants who reported fewer attention errors were also better able to detect the upcoming hazard following occlusion. In addition, our results demonstrate a relationship between self-reported attentional errors and the ability to predict upcoming hazards on the road, with driving experience having a moderating role. In the case of novice drivers, as their scores in the Manoeuvring Errors ARDES factor increase, their ability in Hazard Prediction diminishes, while for experienced drivers the increase is not significant. Guidance on how to improve training for drivers in order to mitigate the effects of inattention on driving safety can be addressed.}

Handrail height did not significantly affect handrail contact time (i.e., time from perturbation onset to handrail contact) or movement time (i.e., time from EMG latency to handrail contact). Participants appeared to compensate for the increased hand-handrail distance with higher rails via increased peak upward hand speed, and decreased vertical handrail overshoot. Aging was associated with slower EMG latency, reduced hand acceleration time, and increased hand deceleration time. Our findings suggest that participants were not disadvantaged by higher handrails from reach-to-grasp timing or speed perspectives, and that other metrics (e.g., center-of-mass control after grasping) may be more important when evaluating handrail designs for balance recovery.}

abstract = {Prolonged sitting, common in many workplaces, reduces blood flow to the lower limb and has negative health outcomes. CoreChair is an active-sitting chair that encourages increased movement to help mitigate these outcomes. Physiological and cognitive measures were recorded in ten subjects over 4 h of sitting in both the CoreChair and a traditional office chair. Sitting in both chairs led to increases in calf circumference (p < 0.0001), reduced tactile sensitivity (p = 0.02), and a cognitive decline in attention (p = 0.035) over time. However, the increase in calf circumference was smaller in the CoreChair at the second (p = 0.017) and third hour (p = 0.012) compared to the traditional chair. Additionally, for the attention task, the traditional chair generated more attention-task errors (p = 0.005), while no changes were observed with the CoreChair (p = 0.13). These findings suggest that during prolonged sitting CoreChair may have modest physiological and cognitive benefits compared to a traditional chair.}

abstract = {Driving simulation is widely used to answer important applied research questions, however, it is vital for specific driving tasks to undergo appropriate behavioural validation testing. Many previous validation studies have used simple driving tasks and measured relatively low-level vehicle control. The purpose of the current study was to investigate whether drivers’ visual attention at intersections with different levels of demand, are similar in the simulator and on the road. Unlike simpler driving tasks, crossing intersections requires complex interactions with other vehicles governed by sequences of head and eye movements that may not be accurately captured in a simulated environment. In the current study we directly compare performance at simulated junctions with the same participants' behaviour in a real car. We compared drivers’ visual attention in a high-fidelity driving simulator (instrumented car, 360-degree screen) and on-road in both low and medium demand driving situations. The low and medium demand driving situations involved the same motor movements, containing straight on, right turn and left turn manoeuvres. The low demand situations were controlled by the road environment and traffic lights, whereas medium demand situations required the driver to scan the environment and decide when it was safe to pull out into the junction. Natural junctions in Nottingham were used for the on-road phase and the same junctions were recreated in the simulator with traffic levels matched to those that were encountered on the real roads. The frequency and size of drivers' head movements were not significantly different between manoeuvres performed in the simulator and those conducted when driving on real roads. This suggests that drivers' broad search strategies in the simulator are representative of real-world driving. These strategies did change as a function of task demand - compared to low demand situations, behaviour at the medium demand junctions was characterised by longer junction crossing times, more head movements, shorter fixation durations and larger saccadic amplitudes. Although patterns of head movements were equivalent on road and in the simulator, there were differences in more fine-grained measures of eye-movements. Mean fixation durations were longer in the simulator compared to on-road, particularly in low-demand situations. We interpret this as evidence for lower levels of visual engagement with the simulated environment compared to the real world, at least when the task demands are low. These results have important implications for driving research. They suggest that high fidelity driving simulators can be useful tools for investigating drivers’ visual attention at junctions, particularly when the driving task is of at least moderate demand.}

In our study, two groups of participants (novices and experts) judge the riskiness of 28 pairs of stocks under two clutter conditions (low and high). Consistency of judgments and group concordance serve as measures for judgment performance, while mean fixation duration, fixation frequency, and transition matrix density are employed to capture visual attention. Our results reveal significant effects of display clutter and expertise on both the performance measures as well as the visual attention measures.}

Nested within these two situations were three courtesy cue conditions: The robot moved without any explicit courtesy cues, stopped, or moved aside and then stopped. We found statistically significant effects of the courtesy cues on people's self-reported appreciation and the legibility of the robot's motion. Behavioral observations indicated that the robot exhibiting two courtesy cues was less disruptive to the human's own actions and was thus more behaviorally effective. This research demonstrates that kinesic politeness cues can be used effectively in the motion design of service robots.}

In the present study, twenty participants had to carry out two N-Back tasks simultaneously, each subtask having distinct difficulty (0,1 or 2-Back) and importance (1 or 3 points) levels. Participants's cumulative dwell time were collected to assess their attentional strategies. Results showed that depending on the global level of difficulty (combination of the two levels of difficulty), attentional resources of people were driven either by the subtask difficulty (under low-global-difficulty) or the subtask importance (under high-global-difficulty), in a non-compensatory way.

Importantly, to avoid simulator sickness, vision outside the simulator cabin was restricted. Participants (N = 16) were exposed blindfolded to 15-min lateral sinusoidal motion at 0.2 Hz and 0.35 Hz on separate days. These conditions were selected to realize optimal provocativeness of the stimulus given the simulator's maximum displacement and knowledge on frequency-acceleration interactions for motion sickness. Average motion sickness on an 11-point scale was 2.21 ± 1.97 for 0.2 Hz and 1.93 ± 1.94 for 0.35 Hz. The motion sickness increase over time was comparable to that found in studies using actual vehicles. We argue that motion base simulators can be used to incite motion sickness analogous to carsickness, provided considerable restrictions on vision. Future research on carsickness, potentially more prevalent in autonomous vehicles, could benefit from employing simulators.}

In line with theory on embodiment, MANOVA and mediation analysis showed that comfortable seating positively influences mental comfort, which subsequently increases the experience of hospitality (comfort factor). Extra ambient sound (acoustic discomfort) cancels out this effect. Also, people's desire to sit matters: people with a low desire to sit interpret comfortable seats as more caring instead of comfort. Regarding the discussion on (dis)comfort: seating comfort, not discomfort, accounted for the effects. Altogether, the hospitality experienced in a restaurant may be enhanced by offering comfortable seats, making customers feel more comfortable, physically and mentally.}

Participants using pitch-earcons identified SpO2 levels alone, and both SpO2 plus HR levels, significantly better than participants using timbre-earcons: p < .001 in both cases. However, there was no difference between earcon conditions in how effectively HR was identified, p = .422. For both kinds of earcons, identification of SpO2 levels was more compromised by simultaneous changes in HR than identification of HR levels was compromised by simultaneous changes in SpO2, suggesting asymmetric integrality. Overall, pitch-earcons may provide a better intermittent auditory pulse oximetry display than timbre-earcons, especially for clinical contexts when quiet is needed.}

The current study, conducted in Israel, focused on the ability to learn unfamiliar road signs and on the effect of the compliance of those signs with principles of physical and conceptual compatibility (ergonomic principles for symbol design). A preliminary experiment tested the extent to which each of 30 signs, not used in Israel, complied with the compatibility principle. Based on this evaluation, the signs were divided into two distinctive groups – “ergonomic” signs and “non-ergonomic” signs. In the second part of the study, we tested the differences between the two groups of signs in terms of comprehension and learnability, conducting recognition-recall tests among 33 teenagers without a driving license. Results showed a significant design main effect, with a higher comprehension level associated with the ergonomic signs compared to the non-ergonomic signs. A significant learnability main effect was also found, with comprehension levels in the recall test significantly higher than in the recognition test for both groups of signs. In addition, the probability for improvement in comprehension based on learning the meanings of the signs was higher among the ergonomic group of signs. These findings demonstrate the importance of ergonomic design in shaping the understandability and learnability of road signs. The implications of the current results can be most relevant to tourists, as well as novice drivers.}

To address this, a visual search experiment was conducted that tested the attentional guidance of six individual colours (red,blue, green, yellow, orange, purple) in increasingly complex displays. Results showed that the individual colours differed significantly in their level of guidance of attention, and that these differences increased as the visual complexity of the display increased.

Fifteen female participants exerted maximum forces in six directions (i.e. superior, inferior, anterior, posterior, medial, lateral), at five different hand locations, and MAS was measured with the handle oriented at 0° (i.e. horizontal), 45°, 90° (i.e. vertical) and 135°.

abstract = {We aimed to investigate the effects of the visual complexity of in-vehicle information display and driver's age in a driving context. A driving simulator study was conducted where participants performed visual search tasks at different visual complexity levels while driving. Two groups were included, 20 younger drivers (mean age = 28.75 years) and 14 older drivers (mean age = 54.87 years). Older drivers were found to be more vulnerable to the effects of increased visual complexity when performing a visual search task. The task completion time of the younger group increased by about 20% (from 7.69 s to 9.30 s), while the older group increased by about 47% (from 8.92 s to 13.14 s). Further, the driving performance of the older group deteriorated, unlike the younger group. The subjective workload score supported the results of the objective performance measures. These differences can be explained by glance behavior. The total off-road glance duration of older drivers was longer than that of younger drivers, but the average off-road glance duration of younger drivers was longer. In other words, older drivers have a more conservative strategy when dealing with increased visual complexity in a driving context so as not to affect their driving. The findings of this study show that the visual complexity level has a significant effect on driving behaviors, especially in older drivers, which provides insights for designing in-vehicle information displays.}

abstract = {Introduction
A Minnesota union identified to researchers at the University of Minnesota a concern relevant to a possible relation between their daily workload and outcome of occupational injuries among a population of janitors.
Objective
To assess if the ergonomic workload is related to injuries among janitors.
Methods
Following an initial group discussion among janitors, which identified common and hazardous tasks potentially leading to occupational injuries, a questionnaire was developed, pre-tested, and distributed to the janitors. Questions addressed various exposures, including workload, and comprehensive information regarding injury occurrence over two six-month sequential periods (May 2016–October 2016, November 2016–April 2017). Quantitative ergonomic analyses were performed on a sub-group of janitors (n = 30); these included data collection to identify Borg Perceived Exertion (Borg) and Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) scores. Descriptive, multivariable with bias adjustment analyses were conducted on the resulting data.
Results
Eight tasks were found to be common for janitors. All average REBA scores for the tasks were identified in the high-risk category. The task of repeatedly emptying small trash cans (<25lb) was significantly related to injuries. Average Borg scores fell between the very light perceived exertion and somewhat difficult perceived exertion categories. Multivariable regression analyses indicated that age-sex-standardized ergonomic workload, measured by task frequencies and REBA or Borg scores, was positively related to injury occurrence.
Conclusions
Standardized ergonomic workload was positively related to injury occurrence. This information serves as a basis for further research and potential intervention efforts.}

To address these problems, this study proposed a spatial enhancement technique. This study investigated the effectiveness of spatial enhancement keys of a virtual keyboard from various angles and explored the impact of enhanced response time and enhanced protrusion distance on the spatial enhancement technology. Finally, the following conclusions are obtained: (1) The average text input performance of the keyboard using the spatial enhancement technique is significantly better than that of the ordinary virtual keyboard without using the spatial enhancement technique. (2) The recommended time interval for enhanced response time and the protrusion distance are 0–100 ms and 1.85 diopter, respectively. The keyboard angle insignificantly affects the input through the keyboard performance.}

abstract = {Roofers often suffer from musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) to their knees due to spending a large amount of time kneeling while performing work-related roofing activities on sloped rooftops. Several ergonomic studies have identified kneeling as a potential risk factor for knee injuries and disorders. Existing biomechanical models and sensor technologies used to assess work-related risk factors for different construction trades are not applicable in roof work settings especially on slanted rooftop surfaces. This work assesses the impacts of work-related factors, namely working posture and roof slope, on the potential risk of developing knee MSDs due to residential roofing tasks in a laboratory setting. Nine human subjects participated in the experiment and mimicked shingle installation on a slope-configurable wooden platform. Maximum angles of right and left knee flexion, abduction, adduction, and axial rotation (internal and external) were measured as risk indicators using a motion capture system under different roof slope settings. The results demonstrated that roof slope, working posture and their interaction may have significant impacts on developing knee MSDs during roofing activities. Knees are likely to be exposed to increased risk of MSDs due to working in a dynamic kneeling posture during shingle installation. In our study, flexion in both knees and adduction in the right knee were found lower in high-pitched rooftops; however, abduction in the left knee and internal rotation in the right knee were found higher during shingle installation. Hence proper attention is needed for these situations. This study provides useful information about the impact of roof work settings on knee MSDs development, which may facilitate effective interventions such as education, training, and tools to prevent knee injuries in construction roofing tasks.}

Two types of phrases were manipulated: egress immediacy and egress directives. Phrase ordering was also varied. Both experiments demonstrated a minimal fire warning without egress information is perceived less acceptable than warnings with egress information. The warnings rated as most acceptable contained egress directives indicating how to evacuate safely and that it should be done quickly. Furthermore, analyses on warning length revealed longer, specific warnings were rated higher than shorter warnings. However, data in Experiment 2 suggested the longest statements were rated lower than ones that were somewhat shorter. Results are discussed in terms of application to fire emergency warnings and general warning issues in emergencies.}

Experiment 2 tested non-clinician participants' identification of 48 single-patient spearcons while they performed no concurrent task, reading, listening, and saying linguistic tasks. In Experiment 1 the saying task worsened participants' identification of spearcons compared with no concurrent task or reading. In Experiment 2, the saying and listening tasks reduced participants' accuracy at identifying spearcons, but the reading task did not. Listening affected identification accuracy no differently than the saying task did. Concurrent auditory linguistic tasks worsen participants’ identification of spearcons, probably due to auditory modality interference in verbal working memory.}

Eighteen participants conducted five different vacuuming tasks with three upright cleaner models. Electromyography data from seven upper extremity muscles were recorded and analyzed. Normalized muscle activation levels were significantly higher in women compared to men across the five tasks for each muscle group. Median muscular load ranged from 4.5% to 47.5% of the maximum voluntary contraction capacity for female participants and from 2.7% to 23.6% for male participants. These results suggest that household vacuuming with upright vacuum cleaners is physically intensive work, especially for women. Study findings have potential implications for the design of upright vacuum cleaners.}

Seventy-five percent of the participants reported some level of either chronic or acute back pain. Individuals with chronic LBP demonstrated a possible trend (t-test not significant) towards more static sitting behaviour compared to their pain-free counterparts. Furthermore, a greater association was found between sitting behaviour and chronic LBP than for acute pain/disability, which is plausibly due to a greater awareness of pain-free sitting positions in individuals with chronic pain compared to those affected by acute pain.}

Each exposure comprised one of three exoskeleton statuses (standing, high and low sitting on exoskeleton) and three working distances (optimal, far, very far). The order of exoskeleton status and working distance were randomized across subjects. A force platform was used to calculate the mean center of pressure (COP) and absolute (SSABS) and relative static postural stability (SSREL) as measures of postural control as well as the weight transferred to the exoskeleton supports as indicator of physical load. Neck and back angles were recorded together with electrical activity of four bilateral muscles (trapezius, erector, vastus, gastrocnemius). Discomfort was recorded before and after each exposure on an 11-point numeric rating scale. Physical load decreased due to the exoskeleton carrying up to 64% of the subject's body mass. The COP remained within the base of support with the lowest values of static postural stability for high sitting (27%). During sitting, vastus activity increased (∼95–135%) while gastrocnemius activity decreased (∼25%) compared to standing. Trapezius and erector activity levels showed only minor differences between exposures. Larger working distances resulted in a more anterior COP and increased erector activity. Standing without exoskeleton was related to less discomfort (0.5) than sitting on the exoskeleton (∼1.3). Working postures and distances changed SSREL and activity levels of the vastus, gastrocnemius, and erector, but not SSABS. However, postural stability did not approach a critical state in our simulations without external perturbations. Therefore, investigating exoskeletons in the field will provide useful information about their effectiveness and usability in dynamic working situations where external forces could occur.}

In a counter-balanced 2 × 2 driving simulator study, a traditional in-vehicle touchscreen was compared with a virtual mid-air gestural interface, both with and without ultrasound haptics. Forty-eight experienced drivers (28 male, 20 female) undertook representative in-vehicle tasks – discrete target selections and continuous slider-bar manipulations – whilst driving. Results show that haptifying gestures with ultrasound was particularly effective in reducing visual demand (number of long glances and mean off-road glance time), and increasing performance (shortest interaction times, highest number of correct responses and least ‘overshoots’) associated with continuous tasks. In contrast, for discrete, target-selections, the touchscreen enabled the highest accuracy and quickest responses, particularly when combined with haptic feedback to guide interactions, although this also increased visual demand. Subjectively, the gesture interfaces invited higher ratings of arousal compared to the more familiar touch-surface technology, and participants indicated the lowest levels of workload (highest performance, lowest frustration) associated with the gesture-haptics interface. In addition, gestures were preferred by participants for continuous tasks. The study shows practical utility and clear potential for the use of haptified gestures in the automotive domain.}

Employing a secondary device with the touchscreen may reduce the demand but there is some debate about which device is most suitable, with current manufacturers favouring different solutions and applying these internationally. We present an empirical driving simulator study, conducted in the UK and China, in which 48 participants undertook typical in-vehicle tasks utilising either a touchscreen, rotary-controller, steering-wheel-controls or touchpad. In both the UK and China, the touchscreen was the most preferred/least demanding to use, and the touchpad least preferred/most demanding, whereas the rotary-controller was generally favoured by UK drivers and steering-wheel-controls were more popular in China. Chinese drivers were more excited by the novelty of the technology, and spent more time attending to the devices while driving, leading to an increase in off-road glance time and a corresponding detriment to vehicle control. Even so, Chinese drivers rated devices as easier-to-use while driving, and felt that they interfered less with their driving performance, compared to their UK counterparts. Results suggest that the most effective solution (to maximise performance/acceptance, while minimising visual demand) is to maintain the touchscreen as the primary control interface (e.g. for top-level tasks), and supplement this with a secondary device that is only enabled for certain actions; moreover, different devices may be employed in different cultural markets. Further work is required to explore these recommendations in greater depth (e.g. during extended or real-world testing), and to validate the findings and approach in other cultural contexts.}

Many studies have investigated the effects of VAC using 3D displays and expensive complex apparatus and setup to create natural and conflicting viewing conditions. However, a limited number of studies targeted virtual environments simulated using modern consumer-grade VR headsets. Our main objective, in this work, is to test how the modern VR headsets (VR simulated depth) could affect our vergence system, in addition to investigating the effect of the simulated depth on the eye-gaze performance. The virtual scenario used included a common virtual object (a cube) in a simple virtual environment with no constraints placed on the head and neck movement of the subjects. We used ocular biomechanics and eye tracking to compare between vergence angles in matching (ideal) and conflicting (real) viewing conditions. Real vergence angle during immersion was significantly higher than ideal vergence angle and exhibited higher variability which leads to incorrect depth cues that affects depth perception and also leads to visual fatigue for prolonged virtual experiences. Additionally, we found that as the simulated depth increases, the ability of users to manipulate virtual objects with their eyes decreases, thus, decreasing the possibilities of interaction through eye gaze. The biomechanics model used here can be further extended to study muscular activity of eye muscles during immersion. It presents an efficient and flexible assessment tool for virtual environments.}

abstract = {Distractors have been shown to adversely impact individuals' ability to acquire target information. However, not all distractors are the same. Distractors that compete/interfere for the same cognitive resources as the target, are thought to be more detrimental to performance than those that do not compete for the same resources. The aim of the present research was to examine the effect of distractors on individuals' memory, namely recall of key safety messages presented in an airline's pre-flight safety briefing. In a laboratory experiment in which one-hundred and twenty-four participants watched one of four different videos, two of which were paired with a distractor task (grammatical reason and computation task), we identified the adverse effect of the distractor task on recall performance. Minor differences were noted between the two distractor task groups. These results suggest the effect of a distractor on performance may be explained, in general by the additional cognitive load imposed, as opposed to the more specific competition for the same cognitive resources. From an applied perspective, these results highlight the importance of limiting distractors when important information to be remembered is communicated.}

As a part of uniform regulations, Swedish police are mandated to wear body armour and duty belts at all times during work. This study aimed to investigate the effect of different load carriage designs on invehicle sitting pressure and self-rated discomfort among police. Results showed less discomfort when wearing the alternate load carriage system incorporating a load-bearing vest and thigh holster compared to the standard load carriage system consisting of a duty belt. Pressures in the lower back were reduced when wearing the load-bearing vest whereas pressures in the upper back region increased. Relocating appointments away from the waist has the potential to improve sitting positions and the ergonomic situation for police when driving fleet vehicles.}

The survey follows 12 years after an earlier initial survey reported by Dempsey et al. (2005). Approximately 1221 eligible participants were invited by e-mail to participate, and 405 surveys were included in the final analysis. The survey queried use of basic instruments relevant to ergonomic practice as well as more specific analytical tools such as observational techniques for assessing postural demands of work and instrumentation for direct measurement of such demands. Some ergonomic assessment methods appear to have increased in their overall use by U.S. ergonomists compared to 2005 data. This was observed for: RULA, REBA, Psychophysical Upper Extremity Data, Strain Index, and ACGIH TLV for Hand Activity Level. There is minimal evidence of increased overall use of direct measurement approaches in the U.S. There appear to be geographic differences between countries/continents in terms of use of various methods. The use of mobile device/smart phone “apps” by ergonomists was queried and these technologies presently appear to be in early adoption phase with 24–28% of practitioners reporting use of an app in their ergonomics practice.}

EEG and pupil diameter recordings were collected from 47 ATC students (27 more experienced and 20 less experienced) during a high-fidelity, variable workload approach-control scenario. Scenario workload was manipulated by increasing the number of aircraft released and the presence of a divided attention task. Results showed that scenario performance significantly degraded with increased aircraft and the presence of the divided attention task. No scenario performance differences were found between experience groups. The EEG engagement metric significantly differed between experience groups, with less experienced controllers exhibiting higher engagement than more experienced controllers. The EEG workload metric and pupil diameter were sensitive to workload manipulations but did not differentiate experience groups. Commercially available EEG cognitive state metrics may be a viable tool for enhancing ATC training.}

Using a combination of 41 interviews and observations of 15 care managers, we identified a range of technology-related barriers experienced by care managers (total of 163 occurrences). The barriers are related to (lack of) access to information, inadequate information, limited usefulness and usability of the technologies, challenges associated with using multiple health IT, and technical problems. In 43% of the occurrences, care managers describe strategies to deal with the technology barriers; these fit in three categories: nothing/delay (9 occurrences), work-arounds (32 occurrences), and direct action at the individual, team, and organization levels (29 occurrences). Our data show the adaptive capacity of care managers who develop various strategies to deal with technology barriers and are, therefore, able to care for chronically ill patients. This information can be used as input to work system redesigns.}

Two organisations participated in the study. The data collection involved: (i) semi-structured interviews with 26 employees and (ii) process enquiries involving the collection of secondary data and interviews with facility management teams. The findings indicate that limited options for improving an AFO solution lead to lingering work environment problems. By contrast, modifying the solution through systematic processes based on employee feedback helped resolving the initial problems. Over time, this led to an increased appreciation and a sense of collective ownership of the AFO solution.}

There has not been a clear definition of care coordination and its associated activities. This paper provides a two-dimension framework of care coordination for chronically ill patients: 1) coordination activities (i.e. communication and monitoring) and 2) interdependencies (i.e. flow, shared resources, simultaneity). We used this framework in a qualitative content analysis of 12 interviews with healthcare professionals involved in coordinating care of chronically ill patients. We identified a total of 258 care coordination activities and developed categories and sub-categories using the constant comparative method. The first category of care coordination activities involves communication with flow or shared resources interdependencies or both. This category includes arranging services and equipment for the patient, exchanging information about patient transition to different care settings, reporting errors and resolving them, and helping the patient with appointments and transportation. The second category involves monitoring, sometimes combined with communication, with flow or shared resources interdependencies or both. This category includes reviewing medications and services and detecting errors, reviewing patient symptoms and following up if needed, and scheduling follow-up to review patient status. The last category involves communication with simultaneity interdependency. This category involves talking in the same location and developing a plan of care, people exchanging information at the same time, and scheduling delivery of medications/services to correspond with patient arrival home. Finally, we identified characteristics of health information technology that can support these various care coordination activities.}

Ten individuals per display curvature completed a series of four 15 min comparison-proofreading trials at a 600 mm viewing distance. Only proofreading speed benefited from display curvature, with 600R providing the highest mean proofreading speed. Proofreading speed increased and accuracy decreased for all display curvatures over the 1 h proofreading period. Visual discomfort, visual fatigue, and mental workload increased during the first 15 min of proofreading. A decrease in critical fusion frequency during that period indicated increases in visual fatigue and mental workload. A short break between 15 min proofreading tasks could be considered to prevent further degradation of task performance and ocular health.}

Based on these considerations, in this work we propose a new automatized procedure to obtain optimal layouts for software-based interfaces. Eye-tracking and mouse-tracking data collected during the use of the interface is used to obtain the best configuration for its elements. The solutions are generated using a slicing-trees based genetic algorithm. This algorithm is able to obtain really applicable configurations that respect the geometrical restrictions of elements in the interface. Results show that this procedure increases effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction of the users when they interact with the obtained interfaces.}

Thirteen touch-typing computer users (pain: n = 5, non-symptomatic: n = 8) completed three pre-selected computer tasks in the laboratory. Upper trapezius muscle activity was recorded using electromyography and analyzed using EVA with five amplitude and five duration categories. Individuals with neck-shoulder pain spent less time at low amplitudes and exhibited longer uninterrupted periods of muscle activation compared to their non-symptomatic counterparts. Thus, non-symptomatic workers tended to switch between exposure levels more often than individuals with pain. For a majority of EVA variables, ICCs ranged from 0.6 to 0.9, and between-days coefficients of variation were between 0.4 and 2.2.}

abstract = {Objective
We assessed the effects of source type bias (human or automation) on adviser trust in a dual adviser decision-making task.
Background
Source type and reliability's effects on adviser trust have been studied in a dual-adviser context, but the influence of pedigree (perceived expertise) across source types lacked robust investigation. As situations with two decision-aids of uneven pedigree can easily arise, it is critical to understand how operators are biased towards a decision-aid of a certain source type and pedigree.
Method
A decision-making task similar to the paradigm of Convoy Leader (Lyons and Stokes, 2012) was given to participants, where a military convoy route had to be selected in the presence of IEDs and insurgent activity. We measured behavioral reliance and trust attitudes. Pedigree was manipulated via controlled adviser descriptions, in a manner consistent with past investigations (Madhavan and Wiegmann, 2007a).
Results
We found a trust bias towards the human adviser, reversed only when there is a far greater pedigree in the automated adviser. Trust attitudes were also strongly indicative of reliance behaviors.
Conclusion
Pedigree is a strong influencer of trust in a decision-aid and biased towards human advisers. Trust is highly predictive of reliance decisions.
Application
System designers must take care with how “expert” automation is portrayed, particularly if it is used in conjunction with other human advisers (e.g.: conflicting advice from air-traffic control and an onboard system).}

Managing care within the constraints of staff availability and demands is a key concern for both patient care and staff wellbeing, yet has received little attention from healthcare human factors. A study of sixteen clinical staff used Critical Decision Method to understand how work is coordinated and the constraints and criteria that are applied by the roles managing OoH care. The analysis identified ten types of coordination decision that, in turn, underpinned three types of adaptive behaviour – pre-emption, information augmentation and self-organisation – that were crucial for the effective performance in OoH care. These behaviours explain how OoH staff manage the task demands placed on them, individually and as a team.}
