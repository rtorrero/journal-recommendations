abstract = {Thermal comfort modeling has been of interest in built environment research for decades. Mostly the modeling approaches focused on an average response of a large group of building occupants. Recently, the focus has been shifted towards personal comfort models that predict individuals' thermal comfort responses. Currently, thermal comfort responses are collected from the occupants via survey. This study explored if the thermal comfort of individuals could be predicted using machine learning algorithms while relaying on the set of collected inputs from an experiment. The model was developed using experimental data including collected from a previously performed experiment in the climate chamber. Two different approaches based on the output data (thermal sensation and thermal comfort votes) and five different sets of input variables were explored. The algorithms tested were Support Vector Machine with four different Kernel functions (Linear, Quadratic, Cubic and Gaussian) and Ensemble Algorithms (Boosted trees, Bagged trees and RUSBoosted trees). The combination of occupants' heating behavior with a personal comfort system (PCS), skin temperatures, time and environmental data were used for the development of personal comfort models to predict individuals' thermal preference. The study investigated the novel combination of inputs such as the use of skin temperature and settings of the personalized heating system as parameters in predicting personal thermal comfort. The results showed that personal comfort models among all tested approaches and subjects showed the best median accuracy of 0.84 using RUSBoosted trees. Individually looking, the approach using thermal sensation output produced better prediction accuracy. On the other hand, the models based on inputs that consisted of PCS control behavior and mean and hand skin temperatures produced the best prediction accuracy when assessing all tested algorithms. The main limitation of the study is the number of test subjects, and further recommendation is to perform more experiments.}

This complex process has been consistently prone to communication breakdowns. Despite expectations and benefits of electronic health records (EHRs), incomplete, vague, or inappropriate referrals continue to hinder consultations; referrals can be sent to the wrong specialty service; and consultation findings frequently fail to reach referrers. Due to the inadequate support of interpersonal communication afforded by EHRs, these issues persist. Important aspects of ergonomics and human factors engineering frequently appear overlooked during the design and implementation of EHRs. Usability issues have contributed to delays in medical diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. Some of these delays contribute to patient harms. Our multidisciplinary team of clinicians and ergonomics professionals reflects on referral and consultation. We describe how computerization in healthcare should benefit from approaches informed and developed through applied ergonomics and human factors.}

However, there is a gap between the high-level references made to cognitive fit and the low-level ability to identify and measure it during human interaction with visualizations. We bridge this gap by using an electroencephalography metric derived from frontal midline theta power and parietal alpha power, known as the task load index, to determine if cognitive effort measured at the level of cortical activity is less when cognitive fit is present compared to when cognitive fit is not. We found that when there is cognitive fit between the type of problem to be solved and the information displayed by a system, the task load index is lower compared to when cognitive fit is not present. We support this finding with subjective (NASA task load index) and performance (response time and accuracy) measures. Our approach, using electroencephalography, provides supplemental information to self-report and performance measures. Findings from this study are important because they (1) provide more validity to the cognitive fit theory using a neurophysiological measure, and (2) use the electroencephalography task load index metric as a means to assess cognitive workload and effort in general.}

Data were obtained through a semi-structured interview to which eighteen adults responded. All had either complete blindness or severe visual impairment. For orientation, the most common references were texture or changes in ground level/surface, along with such ambient elements as noise or smells. Information presented in Braille was reported as little used, due to difficulty in finding such information. Regarding safety, participants reported feeling unsafe; most mentioned crossing the street as a major risk. Using auditory, tactile or even olfactory signals may provide important information while commuting: thus, designing signals which consider and highlight these senses is paramount. Assessing features and location of existing tactile signals is also required, to identify opportunities for improving the safety and independence of people with visual impairment.}

abstract = {Introduction
Work-related issues are already part of the theoretical framework and the historical rationale that underpin corporate sustainability. However, the relationship between work and sustainability is still little known in company practices. Based on the concepts of activity-centered ergonomics (ACE) and psychodynamics of work (PDW), this paper investigates the meaning of “sustainable work” in Brazilian companies. Thus, two research questions guided this study: How the concept of “sustainable work” can be defined in the perception of companies based on the perspective of ACE and PDW? How the concepts provided by these approaches can help companies in developing practices towards sustainable work?
Method
Case studies conducted in ten Brazilian companies engaged in corporate sustainability practices involving document analysis, interviews, and content analysis.
Results
Companies recognize the importance of human action in organizational processes, by considering people as the cornerstone for ensuring corporate sustainability, and seeking to build a work with meaning and significance. However, i) Improvement actions are usually mitigatory or compensatory, acting on the effects while the root causes remain untouched; ii) Sustainability initiatives focus on individual issues, in most cases on the leader (individual), narrowing its scope and neglecting broader, important topics such as work organization and work content; iii) Both work overload and work for sustainability agenda are usually disregarded; iv) A comprehensive view of health should not be limited to the workplace.
Conclusions
According to companies' perceptions, sustainable work includes but is not limited to integrating work to corporate sustainability guidelines, respecting labor laws and human rights, developing synergy between areas/departments towards sustainability, providing possibilities for constructing health in its multidimensionality with the worker as protagonist, and creating work that is meaningful, pleasurable and leads to happiness and recognition. ACE and PDW offer valuable concepts to support companies in bridging the gap between their corporate sustainability vision and practices, i.e., transforming guidelines into actions towards sustainable work. In this sense, sustainable work is believed to be that which improves the organization's performance and promotes professional development as well as workers' health broadly and positively (not limited to the absence of illness, but in the sense of building health) and well-being. Thus, it fosters respect for and the development of intelligence and creativity (as opposed to alienating work) by performing work that has meaning and significance, understanding the profound importance of physical, cognitive and organizational issues, and above all, the importance of work to the development of culture (Bolis et al., 2014).}

We conducted a two-year longitudinal, qualitative study of this program, conceived to improve the diagnosis and management of patients with rare, multi-system disorders by piloting a re-design of the local system of diagnostic work. Specifically, we (1) compared the configuration and effectiveness of the old system and the re-designed system; and (2) analysed the process of system re-design (i.e., the design, implementation, and operation of the program) in order to understand the factors that contributed to – or inhibited – its success. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our findings for effectively re-designing complex, trans-organisational work systems.}

Seat Effective Amplitude Transmissibility of the seat pan and the seat backrest were calculated to evaluate ride quality. Seat transmissibility ranged between 73.6% for backrest and 177.7% for pan. Based on the results of statistical tests, the hypothesis that the transmissibility of a seat would be influenced by seat cushion conditions was accepted (p < 0.05).

Participants who used the 3D tactile maps could find specific landmarks set as tasks more accurately and arrive at the destination alone getting lost less frequently. Tactile maps composed of 3D points, lines, and areal parts are useful as a support aid for O&M training because they have high tactile readability and can provide the environmental information that individuals with visual impairment require.}

As an initial step in determining how to study care transitions across work systems, we applied the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) 2.0 model, specifically the concept of configuration, to explore older adults' ED-to-home transitions. Our results suggest that configuration is useful for identifying and modeling work system barriers that interact across systems, but does not explicitly allow for the identification and analysis of the system boundaries that are crossed. To fully capture the complexity associated with care transitions, future iterations of SEIPS should introduce a mechanism to capture specific boundary types, so that system analysis can capture when and which boundaries are crossed.}

The results are from a thematic analysis of free-text rail passenger complaints (n = 516) reporting service failures that impacted on customer experience. The study differs from existing research on the pertinent personal and contextual factors for public transport service provision in that it: focuses on the passenger experience resulting from specific incidents (rather than evaluative, overall assessments of satisfaction), generates the factors inductively from the data (rather than a-priori) and uses detailed qualitative cases (rather than quantitative survey data). The findings (1) identify some similar factors to those used in previous research and uncover some new factors for both person and context, (2) provide an understanding of what they mean in terms of the passenger experience and (3) indicate how the factors might need to be measured if they are to be used by the rail industry. The paper concludes by using the outcome of an industry-based validation exercise to describe how the findings could be used in future rail services, namely: predicting where the customer experience is going to be sub-optimal, prioritising responses to particular circumstances, and designing services to better meet customer's needs. This exploratory research is timely, given the need for a more passenger-centric approach to service design and future developments such as smart-ticketing, which could potentially enable greater understanding of who is using the rail network and for what journeys.}

Post-accident conditions such as injuries, disorientation, and exit obstructions may also prevent unobstructed passage for egress within acceptable time limits. The purpose of this study was to redesign and fabricate a roof hatch with a larger opening and evaluate its egress characteristics for a range of typical school bus passengers. The larger roof hatch opening allows greater evacuation flow rates, and is almost functionally equivalent to the evacuation flow rate of the front door on an upright school bus.}

abstract = {Laparoscopic surgery techniques are customarily used in non-invasive procedures. That said traditional surgical instruments and devices used by surgeons suffer from certain ergonomic deficiencies that may lead to physical complaints in upper limbs and back and general discomfort that may, in turn, affect the surgeon’s skills during surgery. A novel design of the laparoscopic gripper handle is presented and compared with one of the most used instruments in this field in an attempt to overcome this problem. The assessment of the ergonomic feature of the novel design was performed by using time–frequency analysis of the surface electromyography (sEMG) signal during dynamic activities. Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) was used to decompose the sEMG signal and extract the median frequency of each muscle to assess muscle fatigue. The results reveal that using the proposed ergonomic grip reduces the mean values of the muscle activity during each of the proposed tasks. The novel design also improves the ease of use in laparoscopic surgery as it minimises high-pressure contact areas, reduces large amplitude movements and promotes a neutral position of the hand, wrist and forearm. Furthermore, the SSA method for time–frequency analysis provides a powerful tool to analyse a prescribed activity in ergonomic terms. The proposed methodology to assess muscle activity during surgery activities may be useful in the selection of surgical instruments when programming extended procedures, as it provides an additional selection criterion based on the surgeon’s biomechanics and the proposed activity.}

Four groups of findings were synthesized: definitions, key dimensions, technical tools, and research settings employed in the research. First, definitions of resilience, improvisation, and adaptation were summarized and critically evaluated. Second, four key dimensions of EM resilience were identified: collective sensemaking, team decision making, harmonizing work-as-imagined and work-as-done, and interaction and coordination. Third, this review identified five prevalent technical tools used to enhance resilience in EM: mapmaking, event history logging, mobile communication applications, integrated information management system, and decision support tools. Fourth, two major design features of emergency simulations, incident scenarios and participant roles, are evaluated. For each finding, directions for future research efforts to improve resilience in EM are proposed.}

The purpose of this study was to evaluate trade-offs in joint moments between the trunk, shoulder, and elbow during repetitive upper extremity work. Participants performed four simulated workplace tasks cyclically until meeting fatigue termination criteria. Emergent fatigue-induced adaptations to repetitive work resulted in task-dependent trade-offs in joint moments. In general, reduced shoulder moments were compensated for by increased elbow and trunk joint moment contributions. Although mean joint moment changes were modest (range: 1–3 Nm) across participants, a wide distribution of responses was observed, with standard deviations exceeding 10 Nm. Re-distributing biomechanical demands across joints may alleviate constant tissue loads and facilitate continued task performance with fatigue but may be at the expense of increasing demands at adjacent joints.}

Simulation software and test equipment are able to measure changes in vibration that are too small for humans to perceive. It is therefore important to know how large the change in vibration should be, i.e. the difference threshold, for occupants to perceive an improvement in comfort. This study estimates difference thresholds for ten automotive engineers seated in a vehicle on a 4-poster test rig. Participants were exposed to multi-axis vibration. Component ride values were calculated by applying BS 6841 frequency weightings and multiplication factors to seat accelerations in the six directions. Difference thresholds were estimated for two road profiles using the vertical component ride value and combined point ride value (i.e. the root-sums-of-squares of the six component ride values). The two road profiles had different magnitudes, but the same spectral shape, resulting in median vertical component ride values of 0.58 and 1.01 m.s.−2, root-mean-square. An up-down transformed response rule was used with a three-down-one-up response grouping to estimate difference thresholds at a 79.4% probability level. The median relative difference threshold for the two roads was 10.13% and 8.58% considering the vertical component ride value, and 10.99% and 9.24% considering the combined point ride value. No statistically significant difference was found between the medians of the relative difference threshold over the two roads considering either of the two ride values (p-value = 0.995 in both instances), suggesting that Weber's law holds.}

However, these are usually addressed separately from other functional requirements, resulting in designs that do not support resilient performance. This study proposes a framework for the integrated modelling of built environment and other functional requirements, relying on two approaches: Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM), and Building Information Modelling (BIM). Requirements are defined as equivalent to the precondition aspect of FRAM functions. BIM allows the creation of a database of requirements and functions, linked to an object-oriented model of the built environment. The proposed framework was devised and tested in an intensive care unit. Findings shed light on the necessary resilience to cope with the gap between built environment-as-imagined in design and built environment-as-done due to performance adjustments. This type of resilience may have a long-lasting nature, as many built environment attributes cannot be easily changed.}

One-hundred and forty-seven female Australian Defence Force soldiers completed a 59-item questionnaire regarding the fit and function of current body armour. Most (68%) participants reported wearing ill-fitting body armour, which was associated with increased total musculoskeletal pain and discomfort, as well as pain at the shoulders, abdomen, and hips. Body armour that was too large was more likely to interfere with task performance when it was integrated with a combat belt, as well as when female soldiers performed operationally representative tasks. Modifying body armour design and sizing to cater to the anthropometric dimensions of female soldiers is recommended.}

We then compare different sensor fusion algorithms considering the fundamentals discussed using laboratory-based measurements of upper arm elevation collected under three motion speeds. Results indicate peak displacement errors of <4.5° with a computationally efficient, non-proprietary complementary filter that did not account for gyroscope bias during each of the one-minute trials. Controlling for gyroscope bias reduced peak displacement errors to <3.0°. The complementary filters were comparable (<1° peak displacement difference) to the more complex Kalman filters.}

A seat pressure mat device was used to gather seat pressure data during sitting. Postural shifts were determined by analysis of the dispersion index of both ischial tuberosities from seat pressure data. The threshold for a postural shift was set at ±10% and ±20%. Perceived discomfort in all body regions increased continuously during a 4-h sitting period. The body regions with the highest perceived discomfort were the low back, buttocks, upper back, thigh, and neck. The average (±SD) numbers of postural shifts during the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th hour of sitting were 14.8 ± 9.5, 17.8 ± 9.4, 18.2 ± 11.1, and 18.1 ± 9.8 shifts per hour for the 10% threshold, and were 4.8 ± 4.4, 6.0 ± 5.6, 7.4 ± 6.7, and 7.7 ± 6.6 shifts per hour for the 20% threshold, respectively. Prolonged sitting led to an increase in perceived musculoskeletal discomfort over time. The number of postural shifts at both magnitudes increased in the first 2 h of sitting and, in the second 2-h period of sitting, only the number of larger postural shifts (with 20% threshold) increased. The findings extend our understanding of sitting behaviors.}

The results showed lower inflation pressures triggering discomfort/pain at the thigh, with tonic compression, and wider pneumatic cuffs. The thresholds were lower during walking than standing still. Deep tissue oxygenation increased during phasic compression and decreased during tonic compression.

abstract = {Manual material handling training (MMHT) is of questionable value according to five meta-analyses. However, little is known about why this is so. The aim of this study is to take a closer look at how MMHT are evaluated in order to identify what could explain judgement about their (lack of) effectiveness. Seventy-seven studies were included in a scoping review, and were analyzed using an inductive grid comprising numerous criteria. Workplace training programs, being the most frequent, were described in these papers in greater detail. Given the broad range of contexts it was found that MMHT differed greatly from one study to the other. All the while, contents presented through these programs were surprisingly uniform, with an emphasis on adopting the safe handling technique commonly known as “straight back, bent knees”, although such training approach principally focuses on the trainee's behaviours, while paying little (to no) attention to the work conditions that might condition correct behavioral display. Limitations of current MMHT are discussed and explanations are given in order to better explain why they are reported to be so ineffective. Concrete recommendations on how to improve them close the paper.}

A total of 135 older adults were evaluated with the developed system, the Elderly Mobile User Interface Ability Evaluation System (EMUIAES). The prediction of age and the use of technology on elderly mobile interface usage were investigated based on the findings of the evaluation. The relationship between performance on Fitts' task and elderly mobile user interface ability (EMUIA) was also examined. The findings showed a strong effect of age on the elderly's use of mobile user interfaces. Previous experience with personal and tablet computers also contributed to the use of mobile user interfaces. In addition, this research demonstrated the application of Fitts' law to describe the elderly mobile user interface behaviors, particularly for tasks involving fast tapping and pointing. The EMUIAES can provide future researchers and designers a comprehensive tool to describe the elderly's diverse behaviors and changes in their ability to use mobile interfaces. Individualized interface designs for elderly users can be developed based on these findings to improve the elderly users' experiences of using technology.}

The intervention group exhibited higher intraocular pressure values before the oral presentation (corrected p-values<0.001), with these changes being positively associated with the perceived levels of public speaking anxiety (p < 0.001, r = 0.71). Our results reveal a mediating role of public speaking anxiety on the intraocular pressure responsiveness to oral examination stress, and highlight the utility of intraocular pressure as an indicator of stress in applied situations.}

The turning tasks were performed in two turning directions (toward vs. away relative to caregivers) using five device conditions: draw sheet, friction-reducing turning sheet, air-assisted transfer device, air-assisted turning device, and no assistive device. Low back and upper extremity muscle activity, trunk and shoulder postures, low back moment, and self-reported usability ratings were evaluated. While all assistive devices reduced trunk flexion, both air-assisted transfer and turning devices reduced the trunk flexion (p's < 0.001) and muscle activity (p's < 0.001) in the erector spinae and triceps compared to no assistive device condition.

Dependent measures included mean angles of force application, peak forces recorded from both technologies, and cart velocity. Excellent agreement was observed between technologies (ICC = 0.998). Likewise, peak forces using the single-axis gauge at the fast pace agreed best with the natural test condition (ICC = 0.631). Forces should be measured using a faster initial acceleration and sustained velocity than is prescribed by the current standard if they are to accurately approximate forces relative to existing push/pull guidelines. Future work should also develop recommendations for measuring turning forces.}

Due to the demographic challenge in most countries it is important to consider making work life sustainable. A sustainable work life is of importance in all age groups when working life will be extended to a higher age.
Aim
Towards a theoretical model with an impact on a sustainable working life for all ages, the swAge - model.
Method
The theoretical model, the swAge-model, is developed based on grounded theory using qualitative studies, quantitative studies, intervention projects and literature reviews.
Result
The swAge-model states the interactions between different ageing concepts; chronological, mental, biological and social ageing, and the nine areas of importance for individuals’ work life participation. The model also states the four consideration areas whether individuals can and want to participate in an extended working life or not. The model also includes proposed measures at the organisation/enterprise level and at the society level based on the four activity areas at the individual level.
Conclusion
The theoretical swAge-model describes how to reflect on working life and presents tools to extend work life in a sustainable way for older workers in modern society. The swAge-models’ analysis and measure matrix is included as appendix 1. In the Nordic countries the theoretical model is use in the critical debate and as a tool for managers and authorities to make the working life sustainable for all ages.}

Surface electromyography for the upper extremities and back muscles and motion data were collected. The Staxi showed a statistical trend for higher wrist extensor and flexor carpi ulnaris activity compared to the Stryker chair (p ≤ 0.078) and greater wrist flexion than the Stryker and depot chairs (p ≤ 0.004).

Recent experiments and lubrication theory suggest that the size of the worn region is an important contributor to the shoe tread's ability to drain fluid and therefore the under-shoe friction. This study evaluated a simple test for comparing the size of the worn region relative to a common object (AAA and AA battery) as a means of determining shoe replacement. This study consisted of three components involving slip-resistant shoes: Experiment #1: a longitudinal, mechanical, accelerated wear experiment; Experiment #2: a longitudinal experiment where the same shoes were tested after each month of worker use; and Experiment #3: a cross-sectional experiment that exposed participants to a slippery condition, while donning their own worn shoes. The COF (Experiments #1 and #2); under-shoe fluid pressure (all experiments); and slip severity (Experiment #3) were compared across outcomes (fail/pass) of the battery tests. Larger fluid pressures, lower coefficient of friction, and more severe slips were observed for shoes that failed the battery tests compared with those passing the tests. This method offers promise for assessing loss in friction and an increase in slip risk for slip-resistant shoes.}

However, it was seen that more research in this area with more interactive virtual content is required. This study is an important step in understanding how AR may affect future work in industrial and safety-critical environments.}

EDSCB varied systematically on three automation reliability measures: accuracy, d', and positive predictive value (PPV). Results showed that when unaided performance was high, operator confidence was high, and automation provided only small benefits. When unaided performance was lower, operator confidence was lower, and automation with higher d' provided large benefits. Operator compliance depended on the PPV of automation: We found lower compliance for lower PPV. Automation with a high false alarm rate of 20% and a low PPV of .3 resulted in operators ignoring about one-half of the true automation alarms on difficult targets—a strong cry-wolf effect. Our results suggest that automation reliability described by d' and PPV is more valid than using accuracy alone. When the PPV is below .5, operators should receive clear instructions on how to respond to automation alarms.}

The data gathered were used to analyse cycle-time, assembly performance, muscular load, and kinematic adaptations. The flexible pacing condition was found to improve production performance, increasing customised assembly cycle-time and reducing biomechanical load, for both young and older participants. However, as the task required fine manual dexterity, older participants were subjected to a higher biomechanical load, even in the flexible pacing scenario. These results should encourage assembly-line designers to allow flexible time constraints as much as possible and to be particularly attentive to the needs of older workers.}

The results indicated that, while both cue utilisation and situational awareness were related to the detection of the implicit pattern of train movements, they contributed separately to performance on the simulated rail control task.

The results showed reduced time in trunk inclination ≥20°, ≥30° and ≥45° and dominant upper arm elevation ≥30° and ≥45° when the workers received feedback, and for trunk inclination ≥20°, ≥30° and ≥45° and dominant upper arm elevation ≥30°, after feedback withdrawal. The workers perceived the system as useable, comfortable, and supportive for learning. The system has the potential of contributing to improved postures in order picking through an automated short-term training program.}

The aim of this study was to communicate principles from resilient healthcare to clinicians through a serious video game, and to evaluate the game's feasibility as a prompt to reflect on practice. The game, Resilience Challenge, is scenario-based and requires players to resolve dilemmas in clinical practice. It was disseminated online, and was played 1949 times during the four-month study. The game was evaluated using an immediate cross-sectional survey, which included both Likert-style and free text responses. Participants reported that the game was engaging (93%) and that they would recommend it to others (89%). Fewer participants reported learning about resilient healthcare concepts (64%). Resilience Challenge is a promising way to prompt reflections about clinical work, and demonstrates mixed outcomes in communicating resilient healthcare principles to clinicians.}

The mean values of accuracy and time of response to stimuli in N-back test as well as neurophysiological responses were measured. In the studied experiment configurations, with increasing air temperature and noise, the working memory and neurophysiological responses were disturbed. The results indicated the significant effect of noise on working memory, as compared with that of air temperature. The effects of air temperature on heart rate, respiratory rate as well as theta and alpha bands were more significant than the impact of noise. The combined effects of noise and air temperature were more significant than the influence of each of them alone. In the presence of high noise levels, the increase in air temperature did not worsen the response accuracy. However, in the presence of high noise level, the rise in air temperature aggravated the mean value of neurophysiological responses. Overall, noise has a greater effect on working memory, while the air temperature can disturb neurophysiological responses in a more profound way.}

A relatively new and promising method in this area is the box task combined with a detection response task (BT + DRT). However, no evaluation regarding the BT's sensitivity currently exists. Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the BT + DRT by comparing its sensitivity to the sensitivity of already established methods. Twenty-nine participants engaged in several artificial and realistic secondary tasks while either performing the BT + DRT, the Lane Change Test (LCT), or driving through a simple course in a simulator. The results showed that the BT parameters (especially the standard deviation of box position and size) were sensitive to differences in demand across the visual-manual secondary tasks. This was comparable to what was found with the LCT. Surprisingly, the BT performance measures were more sensitive than those of the driving simulation task. The BT + DRT also captured cognitive distraction effects with the integration of the DRT. Hence, the BT + DRT could be a cost-effective method to assess in-vehicle system demand. However, further investigations are necessary to better understand the potential of the BT method.}

Wearing both BSEs significantly reduced peak levels of trunk extensor muscle activity (by ~9–20%) and reduced energy expenditure (by ~8–14%). Such reductions, though, were more pronounced in the symmetric conditions and differed between the two BSEs tested. Participants reported lower perceived exertion using either BSE yet raised concerns regarding localized discomfort. Minimal changes in lifting behaviors were evident when using either BSE, and use of both BSEs led to generally positive usability ratings.

Seventeen participants were asked to contact the plates with their fingers and rate their thermal sensation using the magnitude estimation approach. Results showed that thermal sensation magnitude and plate temperature followed a power function. The differences in sensation magnitude can be attributed to the thermal inertias of different materials. The findings suggested that laminated plate was generally perceived cooler when heated. Given that the surface temperature of plate is higher than skin, the thermal sensation magnitude increases with contact duration.}

Medical students (32), residents (41), attending surgeons (10), and retirees (2) were recorded on digital video while suturing on one of: foam, pig feet, or porcine bowel. Depending on time in position, each medical student, resident, and attending participant was classified as junior or senior, yielding six experience categories. This work focuses on trends associated with increasing tenure observed from those medical students (10), residents (15), and attendings (10) who sutured on foam, and draws comparison across tissue types where pertinent. Utilizing custom software, the two-dimensional location of each of the participant's hands were automatically recorded in every video frame, producing a rich spatiotemporal feature set. While suturing on foam, increasing clinician experience was associated with conserved path length per cycle of the non-dominant hand, significantly reducing from junior medical students (mean = 73.63 cm, sd = 33.21 cm) to senior residents (mean = 46.16 cm, sd = 14.03 cm, p = 0.015), and again between senior residents and senior attendings (mean = 30.84 cm, sd = 14.51 cm, p = 0.045). Despite similar maneuver rates, attendings also accelerated less with their non-dominant hand (mean = 16.27 cm/s2, sd = 81.12 cm/s2, p = 0.002) than senior residents (mean = 24.84 cm/s2, sd = 68.29 cm/s2, p = 0.002). While tying, medical students moved their dominant hands slower (mean = 4.39 cm/s, sd = 1.73 cm/s, p = 0.033) than senior residents (mean = 6.53 cm/s, sd = 2.52 cm/s). These results suggest that increased psychomotor performance during early training manifest through faster dominant hand function, while later increases are characterized by conserving energy and efficiently distributing work between hands. Incorporating this scalable video-based motion analysis into regular formative assessment routines may enable greater quality and consistency of feedback throughout a surgical career.}

Masons have a high rate of musculoskeletal disorders among construction workers and greater than all other industries. Viable solutions to musculoskeletal hazards have been identified by industry stakeholders, yet masons receive minimal ergonomics training. Apprentices, as the next generation of masons, need training and strategies to identify and speak up about ergonomic and safety issues on job sites. To fill this gap, our team developed the Safety Voice for Ergonomics (SAVE) training program.
Methods
The interactive, 7-unit SAVE program was developed specifically for masonry brick and block apprentices. This innovative training contains detailed ergonomics lessons focusing on risk factors and solutions specific to this masonry craft. It also contains lessons that provide communication and problem solving strategies. Evaluation of SAVE employed a randomized control trial designed to assess the effectiveness of SAVE for apprentices over a six-month period.
Results
Our findings demonstrated that compared to controls, SAVE trained apprentices used their safety voice more (P = .049) and had greater safety participation (P = .028). They adopted more ergonomic practices such as adjusting scaffolding (P = .016) and using better body postures (P = 042). Apprentices liked SAVE and indicated that it prompted them to change workplace safety behaviors.
Conclusions
SAVE is an effective program, providing needed ergonomic and safety communication training for workers as they begin their trade. The broad adoption of SAVE training by the masonry industry has the potential to empower apprentices, elevate the trade's safety culture, and ultimately reduce musculoskeletal disorders.}

abstract = {Objective
Currently, low back disorder (LBD) research focuses primarily on mechanical variables to assess whether task demands exceed tissue capacity; however, it is important to assess how other nonmechanical variables affect tissue capacity in a time-dependent manner. The current investigation sought to explore physiological responses to an acute lifting task, as lifting has been implicated as a risk factor in the development of LBDs.
Methods
Twelve participants completed two sessions of 2 h of repetitive symmetrical lifting from floor to knuckle height under two conditions, matched for total external work (Low Force High Repetition (LFHR) and High Force Low Repetition (HFLR)). Full-body kinematics and ground reaction forces were measured throughout. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin 8 (IL-8), markers of systemic inflammation, were assessed from blood sampling at Baseline, 0, 4 and 24 h post-lifting on both days. Dual x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans were also performed on participants to quantify body composition.
Results
Significant load (HFLR and LFHR) * time (Baseline, 0, 4, 24 h) interaction effects were found for both IL-6 and IL-8, where the LFHR condition resulted in greater responses at 0 and 4 h post-lifting.
Conclusions
This was the first study of its kind to concurrently measure peak and cumulative spinal moments and their relationship to systemic inflammation in both sexes, while strictly controlling for confounding variables (e.g. physical activity, caloric intake, body composition, etc.). Greater levels of IL-6 and IL-8 were seen in the LFHR condition, likely due to the greater cumulative spinal moments in this condition.}

An investigation of muscle activity, Jonsson’s (Jonsson, 1982) ergonomic acceptance ranges, and shoulder range of motion was conducted with a sample of 12 workers using an upper extremity exoskeleton in an automotive assembly line. The operators performed continuous cycles of dynamic overhead work consisting of the assembly of the car body at the underside of the car making use of pneumatic screwdrivers. The EMGs (anterior part of deltoid, trapezius, latissimus dorsi and erector spinae) were measured for the muscle activity analysis on the one hand, and for the ergonomics study on the other hand. The latter consisted of an approach based on Jonsson’s work, that establishes acceptance thresholds of cumulative percentage of maximum voluntary contraction of muscle activity (%MVC) in a work cycle. The joint angles motion capture was carried out by measuring the angles of the neck, back, and arms joints. All measurements were performed during experimental sessions with and without an exoskeleton. The key findings show reductions of 34% and 18% of the deltoid and the trapezius muscular activities, respectively, which in turn could lead to a reduction of discomfort and fatigue. The erector spinae and latissimus dorsi muscles were not significantly affected by exoskeleton. The values of muscular activity were also represented over Jonsson’s acceptance areas. Referring to the posture, some differences were found in the range of movement of back, neck, and arms owing to the use of the exoskeleton; however, the differences were smaller than 5% in all cases.}

Sleepiness was measured using Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). Nocturnal total sleep time (TST) was measured with wrist actigraphy. SCMs and naps were self-reported with a smartphone application. Caffeine and napping were considered effective SCMs. Severe sleepiness (KSS ≥ 7) was observed in 22% of shifts with no differences between shift types. Rest breaks were associated with slight reductions in sleepiness. TST between days off averaged 7 h but was 1 h 33 min and 38 min shorter prior to morning and day shifts, respectively. The use of effective SCMs showed little variance between shift types. These results highlight the need for fatigue management in non-night-working tram drivers.}

Through a Self-Organising Map analysis we identified four similar response profiles to the evocativeness scale, differing in their mean strength. A non-metric Multidimensional Scaling suggested that evocativeness was higher for the emojis featuring a damaged building. Linear Mixed Models indicated that emojis with fabricated vs. natural structures were judged as more evocative, simpler, and more universal when characterized by danger from falling objects.

abstract = {Women experience higher prevalence of work-related upper limb musculoskeletal disorders compared to men. Previous studies have investigated the biological, kinematic and electromyographic sex-related differences during a lifting task but the actual differences in musculoskeletal loads remain unknown. We investigated the sex differences in three musculoskeletal indicators: the sum of muscle activations, the sum of muscle forces and the relative time spent beyond a shear-compression dislocation ratio. A musculoskeletal model was scaled on 20 women and 20 men lifting a 6 or 12kg box from hip to eye level. Women generated more muscle forces and activations than men, regardless of the lifted mass. Those differences occurred when the box was above shoulder level. In addition, women might spend more time beyond a shear-compression dislocation ratio. Our work suggests higher musculoskeletal loads among women compared to men during a lifting task, which could be the result of poor technique and strength difference.}

Symptoms increased over time but were not different with respect to headset or motion. The VR condition had higher accuracy and faster response time to the commence fire instruction. Further research is necessary to determine if this holds under more extreme motion. The use of VR or AR headsets for training under gentle motion conditions is practicable and should be permissible under normal conditions during deployment.}

Sixteen incident reports from French civil aviation crash investigation bureau were analysed using the AcciMap method. Contributory and protective factors, and relationships between both were identified via coding of the reports. The results indicate that considering protective factors support a richer picture of incidents and provide support for the common cause hypothesis as measured by similar mean factor volume and sociotechnical levels for both contributory and protective factors. However, the findings also show the direction of relationships among protective and contributory factors may be indicative of a difference among adverse outcomes, near misses, and normal work. Future research should consider how a network of relationships may impact on the common contributory and protective factors found in near misses.}

abstract = {Background
Despite the breadth and diversity of research and policies on care transitions, research studies often report similar components that affect the quality and safety of care, including communication across professional groups and care settings, transfer of information, coordination of resources or training of healthcare personnel. In this article, we aim to deepen our understanding of care transitions by proposing a heuristic research framework that takes into account the components and factors influencing the quality and safety of care transitions in diverse settings.
Methodology
Using a pragmatic qualitative narrative meta-synthesis of empirically grounded research studies (N = 13) involving 31 researchers from seven countries (Australia, Canada, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and the UK), we conducted a thematic analysis to identify the components analysed in the included studies. We then used these components to create a framework for researching care transitions.
Results
Our narrative synthesis found that the quality and safety of care transitions are influenced by a range of patient-centred, communicative, collaborative, cultural, competency-based, accountability-based and spatial components. These components are encompassed within a broader set of dimensions that require careful consideration: (1) the conceptualising of the care transition notion, (2) the methodology for researching care transitions, (3) the role of patients and carers in care transitions, (4) the complexity surrounding care transitions, (5) the boundaries intertwined in care transitions and (6) care transition improvement interventions. These six dimensions constitute an analytical framework for planning and conducting research on care transitions in diverse settings.
Conclusion
The proposed six-dimensional framework for researching quality and safety in care transitions offers a roadmap for future practice and policy interventions and provides a starting point for planning and designing future research.}

Previous methods such as using depth cameras suffered from limited visual range and wearable sensors could cause intrusiveness to the workers, both of which are less feasible for long-run on-site applications. This document examines a novel end-to-end implementation of a deep learning-based algorithm for rapid upper limb assessment (RULA). The algorithm takes normal RGB images as input and outputs the RULA action level, which is a further division of RULA grand score. Lifting postures collected in laboratory and posture data from Human 3.6 (a public human pose dataset) were used for training and evaluating the algorithm. Overall, the algorithm achieved 93% accuracy and 29 frames per second efficiency for detecting the RULA action level. The results also indicate that using data augmentation (a strategy to diversify the training data) can significantly improve the robustness of the model. The proposed method demonstrates its high potential for real-time on-site risk assessment for the prevention of work-related MSD.

In a repeated-measures laboratory-based study, 20 participants (10 males) performed three standardized AR tasks (3-dimensional (3-D) cube, omni-directional pointing, and web-browsing tasks) with three target distances (0.3, 0.6, and 0.9 m from each participant denoted by near, middle, far targets) for the 3-D cube and omni-directional pointing tasks or three target sizes: small (30% smaller than default), medium (default: 1.0 × 1.1 m), and large (30% larger than default) for the web-browsing task. Joint angle, joint moment, muscle activity, self-reported discomfort and comfort in the neck and shoulders; and subjective usability ratings were measured. The results showed that shoulder angle (flexion and abduction), shoulder moment (flexion), middle deltoid muscle activity significantly increased as the target distance increased during the 3-D cube task (p's < 0.001). Self-reported neck and shoulder discomfort significantly increased after completing each task (p's < 0.001). The participants preferred the near to middle distance (0.3–0.6 m) or the medium to large window size due to task easiness (p's < 0.005). The highest task performance (speed) was occurred at the near distance or the large window size during the 3-D cube and web-browsing tasks (p's < 0.001). The results indicate that AR interactions with the far target distance (close to maximum reach envelop) may increase the risk for musculoskeletal discomfort in the shoulder regions. Given the increased usability and task performance, the near to middle distance (less than 0.6 m) or the medium to large window size (greater than 1.0 × 1.1 m) would be recommended for AR interactions.}

Participants were randomly allocated to four cohorts, being informed that the system's reliability was 100%, 90%, 80% or undisclosed. Results showed that only a DSS known to be 100% reliable resulted in participants systematically following its suggestions, increasing the percentage of correct classifications to a median of 100% while halving both, decision time and number of visually attended information sources. In all other conditions, the DSS had no effect on most visual sampling metrics, while decision quality of the human-DSS team was below the reliability level of the DSS. Knowledge of an even slightly unreliable system hence had a profound impact on joint decision making, with participants trusting their significantly worse performance more than the DSSs suggestions.}

Based on previous findings, one-pedal operation is considered to have the potential to increase positive emotions and decrease cognitive workload. To test this possibility, the present study compared the emotional state and cognitive workload between one-pedal and conventional two-pedal operation. Participants drove a vehicle on public roads, and driving enjoyment (i.e., pleasure and immersion) and the cognitive workload (i.e., ease and effortlessness) were assessed by means of questionnaires. In addition, physiological variations associated with driving pleasure and difficulty were assessed by electroencephalography (EEG). Both the questionnaire and EEG results revealed an increase in driving enjoyment in one-pedal operation. On the other hand, only the EEG results suggested a decrease in the cognitive workload in one-pedal operation; the questionnaire results did not show a significant difference between the pedal conditions. These findings support the notion that one-pedal operation has a positive influence on the driver's mental state, though its influence on the cognitive workload will require further investigation. We discuss future directions toward a better understanding of the effects of one-pedal operation on the driver's mental state.}

abstract = {Surgery has changed significantly in recent years due to the introduction of advanced technologies, resulting in increased system complexity at the technical, human and organisational levels, which may lead to higher variability of patient outcome due to new error pathways. Current approaches towards a safer surgery are largely based on ex-post analysis of events and process monitoring (e.g. root cause analysis, safety checklists, safety audits). However, adopting a proactive approach enables the prior identification of critical factors and the design of safer sociotechnical systems, thanks to a multi-level (or mesoergnomics) perspective. In this paper, a methodology for performing mesoergonomics analysis of surgical procedures is proposed. It is a methodology for Dynamic Human Reliability Analysis in Robotic Surgery based on a modified version of human error assessment and reduction technique (HEART) integrated with a method for incorporating uncertainties related to the influence of personal and organisational factors on the execution of a surgical procedure. The pilot application involves a robot-assisted radical prostatectomy procedure, and the results reveal that team-related factors have the greatest impact on patient outcome variability.}

Twenty-four novice volunteers each completed simulated cutting tasks in 24 conditions involving the factorial combinations of four scissor designs (SD), three workstation heights, and two fabric types. SD significantly affected all outcome measures, and differences between SDs were consistent across workstation heights and fabric types. Two wide-handles scissors appeared superior overall, which may be related to the distinct grip type employed with this type of design. These results suggest that careful scissor selection has the potential to both reduce injury risk and enhance performance during fabric cutting tasks, though future testing is needed under more realistic conditions.}

This new handle has been designed to provide the best ergonomic and usability features required in this kind of surgical interventions.

This enables the surgeon to reach the patient's organs without adopting extremely awkward postures. In order to demonstrate its advantages, the handle has been tested and compared with another commercial handle in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, and satisfaction. To this end, volunteers have been selected for participation in the experimental evaluation, which comprised two types of surveys: objective and subjective. Electromyography and goniometric studies provide objective parameters for evaluation. Questionnaires are used for the subjective assessment. Outstanding results include the lower level of pain reported by the individuals working with the new handle, as well as the reduction in the hyperflexion of the wrist. Compared with the conventional handle, electromyography reveals that no muscle load is increased when working with the new handle. The results of the subjective survey show that volunteers expressed a significant preference for the new handle, demonstrating an improvement in the ergonomic characteristics.}

More specifically, the interface pressure distribution and subjective suitability rating of 23 subjects was assessed in a total of nine (3 × 3) combinations of seat pan (20°, 30°, 40°) and backrest (145°, 155°, 165°) angles. Biomechanical quality was evaluated with an interface pressure score (IPS) based on sensitivity weighted pressures and the total contact area. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed that IPS significantly improves with increasing seat pan angle whereas backrest angles of 155° or 165° lead to significant better IPS compared to flatter ones (145°). The overall highest IPS was observed for a 40°-seat pan angle in combination with a 155°-backrest angle. Subjective suitability rating revealed that people prefer a combination of 165° backrest angle with a seat pan of 20°; however, eight of nine combinations can be considered as suitable for sleeping. Therefore, the combination of a 40°-seat pan angle and 155° backrest is recommended by the present study for an in-vehicle sleeping position due to the increased biomechanical quality.}

The aim of this study was to present a novel battery of tests, designed to assess functional performance and subjective outcomes during the use of assistive trunk exoskeletons, and to assess its test-retest reliability. The battery of tests consists of 12 different simple functional tasks. Twenty participants were included in an intra-session reliability test and repeated the tests within 7–10 days to assess inter-session reliability. They were wearing a novel passive spinal exoskeleton during all trials. The outcomes included quantitative and subjective measures, such as performance time and rating of discomfort and perceived task difficulty. The majority of the outcome measures were reliable within session and between sessions (ICC or α > 0.80). Systematic effects were observed in a few tasks, suggesting that familiarization trials will be needed to minimize the learning effects. The novel battery of tests could become an important easy-to-use tool for functional testing of the spinal exoskeletons in addition to more specific biomechanical and physiological testing. Further studies should address the reliability of the present battery of tests for assessing specific populations, such as low back pain patients and explore how to minimize systematic effects that were observed in this study.}

abstract = {Visual-to-auditory sensory substitution devices (SSDs) provide improved access to the visual environment for the visually impaired by converting images into auditory information. Research is lacking on the mechanisms involved in processing data that is perceived through one sensory modality, but directly associated with a source in a different sensory modality. This is important because SSDs that use auditory displays could involve binaural presentation requiring both ear canals, or monaural presentation requiring only one – but which ear would be ideal? SSDs may be similar to reading, as an image (printed word) is converted into sound (when read aloud). Reading, and language more generally, are typically lateralised to the left cerebral hemisphere. Yet, unlike symbolic written language, SSDs convert images to sound based on visuospatial properties, with the right cerebral hemisphere potentially having a role in processing such visuospatial data. Here we investigated whether there is a hemispheric bias in the processing of visual-to-auditory sensory substitution information and whether that varies as a function of experience and visual ability. We assessed the lateralization of auditory processing with two tests: a standard dichotic listening test and a novel dichotic listening test created using the auditory information produced by an SSD, The vOICe. Participants were tested either in the lab or online with the same stimuli. We did not find a hemispheric bias in the processing of visual-to-auditory information in visually impaired, experienced vOICe users. Further, we did not find any difference between visually impaired, experienced vOICe users and sighted novices in the hemispheric lateralization of visual-to-auditory information processing. Although standard dichotic listening is lateralised to the left hemisphere, the auditory processing of images in SSDs is bilateral, possibly due to the increased influence of right hemisphere processing. Auditory SSDs might therefore be equally effective with presentation to either ear if a monaural, rather than binaural, presentation were necessary.}

This study presents an approach to characterize the repetitive motions of the upper arms based on direct measurement using accelerometers. Repetition rates were derived from upper arm inclination data and with video recordings in the field. This method was used to investigate whether harvesting with mobile platforms (teams harvesting apples from the platform and the ground) increased the farmworkers’ exposure to upper arm repetitive motions compared to traditional harvesting using ladders. The ladder workers had higher repetitive motions (13.7 cycles per minute) compared to the platform and ground workers (11.7 and 12.2 cycles per minutes). The higher repetitions in the ladder workers were likely due to their ability to work independently and the additional arm movements associated with ladder climbing and walking.}

This study assessed the work-related physical demands of short-distance truck drivers employed by a large gas delivery company in Canada.
Methods
A total of 19 truck drivers participated in the data collection, which included a combination of self-reports, field observations and direct measurements to report on the work shift task composition, postures, physical workload, and force exertions.
Results
Driving (mean of 43% of daily work shift) and delivering gas cylinders to customers (28%) were the main tasks of the truck drivers. Delivering gas cylinders measured as moderate level work and daily work duration was not excessive with respect to mean cardiac strain for most drivers. However, manual handling and force exertion activities were frequent and deemed unsafe most of the time with respect to existing guidelines on manual materials handling.
Conclusion
This study documents physical risk factors that are consistent with musculoskeletal pain prevalence reported for short-distance truck drivers.}

The purpose of this research was to examine the ergonomic benefits of utilizing the laterally-tilting function of operating room (OR) tables during such transfers – along with different friction-reducing devices (FRD). This method allows the patient to slide down to the adjacent surface as one nurse guides the transfer and another controls the OR table angle with a remote control. Sixteen nursing students and sixteen college students were recruited to act as nurses and patients, respectively. Two OR table angles were examined: flat and tilted. Three FRD conditions were considered: a standard blanket sheet, a plastic bag, and a slide board. Electromyography (EMG) activities were measured bilaterally from the posterior deltoids, upper trapezii, latissimus dorsi, and lumbar erector spinae muscles. The Borg-CR10 scale was used for participants to rate their perceived physical exertions. The efficiency of each method was measured using a stopwatch. Results showed that the tilted table technique completely replaced the physical efforts that would have been exerted by the pushing-nurse, in that muscle activation did not increase in the pulling-nurse. On the contrary, EMG activities of the pulling-nurse for most of the muscles significantly decreased (p < 0.05). The subjective Borg-ratings also favored the tilted table with significantly lower ratings. However, the tilted table required on average 7.22 s more than the flat table to complete the transfer (p < 0.05). The slide board and plastic bag were associated with significantly lower Borg-ratings and EMG activities for most muscles than blanket sheet, but they both were not significantly different from each other. However, they each required approximately 5 s more than the blanket sheet method to complete the patient transfer (p < 0.05). By switching from flat + blanket sheet to tilted + slide board, EMG activities in all muscles decreased in the range of 18.4–72.3%, and Borg-ratings decreased from about 4 (somewhat difficult) to 1 (very light). The findings of this study propose simple, readily available ergonomic interventions for performing patient lateral transfers that can have significant implications for nurses’ wellbeing and efficiency.}

abstract = {Background
The fast-paced and rapidly changing environment of an Emergency Department (ED) requires providers to have a high level of situation awareness (SA). However, acute clinical care also encompasses a multitude of interruption-laden work processes that might degrade SA. It is therefore important to understand how frequent interruptions affect ED provider cognition in general and SA in particular.
Objective
We aimed to examine how sources and contents of provider workflow interruptions influence situation awareness of ED physicians and nurses.
Methods
This prospective, multi-method study combined standardized observations, self-reports of ED providers, and ED administrative data of staffing and patient load. Expert observers identified ED providers’ workflow interruptions during 90min observation sessions. Afterwards, each provider reported perceived disruptiveness and situation awareness. Controlling for patient load, patient acuity and staffing, we conducted regression analyses to explore prospective associations between interruptions and provider outcomes.
Results
During 74 observation sessions of overall 110h and 40min, we observed 1205 workflow interruptions (mean rate: 10.9 interruptions/hour). Provider situation awareness was fairly high (M = 7.10; scale 0–10) with no difference between ED physicians and nurses. After controlling for ED workload data, we observed that high rates of interruptions were associated with lower levels of situation awareness (β = −0.27). Further analyses revealed that particularly interruptions by telephone/beeper, technical malfunctions as well as interruptive communication related to completed cases were correlated to low SA.
Discussion
This study in a naturalistic ED setting shows that ED physicians and nurses continuously cope with disruptions and interruptions. Our findings reveal that highly interruptive workflow environments impede providers' situation awareness. Moreover, it sheds light on specific sources and contents of interruptions that influence providers’ SA in acute care.
Conclusion
Frequent workflow interruptions can degrade ED providers’ situation awareness. A deeper understanding of how avoidable and unavoidable interruptions affect provider cognitions with particular focus on social and technology-related disruptions is required. Further emphasis should be placed on the effective application of work re-design in this context to foster safe and efficient patient care.}

In this experimental study we quantified the effect of inconsistent rise heights on biomechanical measurements of stepping safety from younger (n = 26) and older adults (n = 33). In ascent, both groups decreased foot clearance (~9 mm) over the inconsistently higher step (F(1,56) = 48.4, p < 0.001). In descent, they reduced foot contact length on the higher step by 3% (F(1,56) = 9.1, p < 0.01). Reduced clearance may result in a toe-catch potentially leading to a trip, while reduced foot contact lengths increase the risk of overstepping which may also lead to a fall. These effects occurred because participants did not alter their foot trajectories, indicating they either did not detect or were not able to adjust to the inconsistent rise, increasing the likelihood of a fall. Consistent stair construction is vital, and existing inconsistencies should be identified and safety interventions developed.}

Physiological measures of emotional activity through skin conductance responses were also investigated, together with subjective measures of mental load using NASA-Task Load Index. Our results followed our expectations, where novice travelers expressed higher cognitive load than expert travelers, characterized by wider pupil diameter, larger amplitude of saccade and longer gaze duration, as well as higher electrodermal activity and NASA-TLX. Additional observations showed that experts used hierarchical and symmetrical scan paths, with more intense exposure on relevant information, characterized by brighter heat maps. This difference in behavior showed a clear difference in strategies for information retrieval at different expertise levels. Metrics of eye tracking device, together with electrodermal activity, proved to be potent in cognitive load analysis of train travelers, and helped to provide insights for real-life information processing.}

Upper arm and back inclinations were continuously monitored during harvesting using tri-axial accelerometers over full work shifts (~8 h). Upper arm posture was characterized as the percentage of time that upper arm flexion and abduction exceeded 30°, 60°, and 90°. Back posture was characterized as the percentage of time that torso angles (sagittal flexion or lateral bending) exceeded 10°, 20°, and 30°. The 10th, 50th, and 90th postural percentiles were also calculated. The platform workers had lower exposures to upper arm flexion and abduction than the ground and ladder workers. There were no differences in torso angles between the ladder and mobile platform workers; however, the ground workers were exposed to more and greater percentages of time in torso flexions.}

The pre- and post-fatigue maximum isometric forces and corresponding electromyography responses were measured to assess the forearm muscle strength loss and fatigue due to screwing. Results showed that after eight bone screws were inserted, the maximal grip force, maximal driving torque and maximal push force losses were approximately 29%, 20% and 23%, respectively. While the grip force and/or driving torque acting, both the brachioradialis and extensor carpi ulnaris had a higher percentage change of EMG than the biceps brachii. The driving forces decreased with the number of screw insertions; however, the insertion time increased parabolically with the number of screws and significantly decreased the insertion rate of the screws, indicating that forearm muscle fatigue may occur in surgeons who treat fracture fixation using more than eight bone screws.}

In a fixed-based driving simulator, 77 (7 longitudinal and 11 lateral) positions of the obstacles were used to quantify the subjectively perceived and objectively (maximum absolute steering angle) measured DRF for eight participants. The subjective response was a numerical answer to the question “How much steering do you think you need at this moment in time?” The results show that the propagation of the width of the DRF, along the longitudinal distance, resembled an hourglass shape, and all participants responded to obstacles that were placed beyond the width of the car. This implies that the Driver's Risk Field is wider than the car width.}

Despite the stated aim of creating value for stakeholders, including employees, companies face difficulties in introducing effective sustainability policies. The research question addressed in this article is the following: How can companies improve their decision-making processes to increase workers' wellbeing using policies integrating issues related to corporate sustainability and ergonomics? Currently, corporate sustainability is focused mainly on the triple bottom line (TBL) concept. In this context, the integration of ergonomics is fragmented and arguably separate from strategic human-resource functions (which have largely been the primary promoter of the internal-social component of corporate sustainability). This research argues that corporate sustainability requires a new step, improving the decision-making process, with the inclusion of more types of rationalities and the recognition of the centrality of workers in the process of creating sustainable action. When corporate sustainability policies focus on worker centrality, they open space for the integration of ergonomics as a pillar of an organization's corporate sustainability strategy. Based on a complex view of work systems, ergonomics can introduce values aligned with sustainability and promote cooperation in organizations. Different stakeholders working at companies can make use of different concepts proposed by ergonomics and other work sciences to support changes in their decision-making processes. In view of broader sustainability objectives, integrating different work-related considerations can help improve performance, including productivity, quality and health.}

Twenty participants performed two 3-h driving sessions, one for each seat, on a static simulator. Every 20 min, participants self-evaluated their level of whole-body and individual body-area discomfort. Surface electromyography (sEMG) was recorded for eight muscles including Trapezius descendens (TD), Erector spinae longissimus (ESL), Multifidus (MF), Vastus lateralis (VL) and Tibialis anterior (TA) throughout the driving sessions. Moreover, an endurance static test (EST) was performed prior to and after each driving session. Whole-body discomfort increased with time with both seats, but no difference in discomfort scores was observed between seats throughout the driving sessions. The highest discomfort scores were for neck and lower back areas with both seats. Neuromuscular fatigue was revealed by a shorter endurance time in post-driving EST for both seats. EMG recordings showed different neuromuscular fatigue profiles for the two seats, with earlier onset of fatigue for S. Despite the lack of difference in perceived discomfort level, the two seats have different impacts: the softness of S induces greater activity of the lower back muscles, while F offers greater support for the lower back.}

The LCA identified a two-class model with mothers' age as a significant covariate. Portability, ease of use, low-weight, fast milk extraction, comfortability, low-noise, and discreet were all found to be important to one group of mothers, while only portability, ease of use, fast milk extraction, and comfortability were found to be important to another group of mothers. Mothers' work status was not a significant covariate but did predict class membership when considered as a grouping variable in conjunction with age. Breast pumping mothers' needs were found to differ based on their work status and age together, and collecting and considering these different needs is vital to creating redesigns that improve mothers’ breast pumping experience.}
