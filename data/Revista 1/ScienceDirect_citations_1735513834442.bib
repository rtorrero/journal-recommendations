abstract = {Many studies of ballpoint pens have been conducted. However, those studies have not considered the emotional factors that can enhance user experience. Styluses resemble ballpoint pens in many ways, which are widely available in a variety of styles. Therefore, in the present study, we explored the physical and emotional attributes that improve user satisfaction with typical ballpoint pens, with the goal of also understanding what factors might be important for stylus design. First, 14 emotional factors associated with the pens were derived. Second, 16 different types of ball-point pens were measured for six physical properties. Then, an experiment was performed to assess user satisfaction and emotional factors for pens. The House of Quality (HOQ) was used to obtain the chief physical properties. Results showed that to increase user satisfaction it is necessary to make pens be comfortable, fine, refined, deep, and natural. Also, we found that for high user satisfaction pens need to be heavier and longer, have thick and antislip grips and thin nibs, and their center of gravity should be located close to the nib to increase user satisfaction.}

Schedule planning systems allowing workers to choose shifts may affect job strenuousness and work-family balance (WFB) for both female and male workers. How could ergonomic interventions related to the implementation of those systems better consider gender dynamics regarding WFB strategies, and minimize inequities among workers? This article presents a joint analysis of two independent case studies related to ergonomic interventions in transport companies in Canada and Switzerland. Direct observation and semi-structured interviews shed light on the characteristics of schedule planning systems and their interaction with men's and women's WFB strategies. Issues related to each step of the planning process (shift construction, schedule choice, day-to-day schedule management) are discussed to inform interventions aimed at facilitating WFB, and ultimately gender equity, in atypical schedule contexts.}

To compute and analyze the influence of resilience engineering (RE) indicators, teamwork, and redundancy on adaptive capacity, data envelopment analysis (DEA) method was used. The results indicate that teamwork and redundancy have a positive effect on enhancing the level of adaptive capacity. Multilayer perceptron (MLP), a machine learning approach, was used to estimate the level of adaptive capacity on the basis of a dataset. The results of DEA and MLP approaches are confirmed by statistical methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that measures quantitatively and improves adaptive capacity by an integrated DEA-MLP approach based on the stress-strain model. The outcomes of this study could assist managers and other decision-makers of complex systems to compute and improve the level of adaptive capacity for coping with upcoming events in abnormal conditions.}

However, one aspect of seating that has not been well studied is leg splay; splay is a rotation at the hips which causes the knees to move outward. The work presented here identified the ranges of “comfortable” splay in different styles of seats and related changes in seating pressure due to leg splay. Sixteen midsized male participants were tested in six seats: a flat control, three mid-sized sedan, a sports car, and a pickup truck. Participants sat with two leg conditions: 1) shoulder width apart and 2) rotating their legs to splay to a self-identified, comfortable position. For each test, the participant placed his left leg on a foot support and right leg on a depressible pedal to mimic a driving position. In each posture, leg angle and seat pan pressures were collected. Of the seats tested, the flat wooden seat had the highest possible splay (24.5°). The three sedan seats had similar splay angles (16.1–18.5°). The lowest splay values were in the sports car seat (8.96°) and truck seat (7.46°). This reduction in splay was attributed to the more aggressive bolsters in the sports car and a higher seat design position in the pickup truck seat. Following participant splay the pressures in the seat bolsters increased while the pressure in the left thigh and left buttocks regions decreased. By determining the comfortable ranges of splay and how pressure distribution is affected, seat designers and automobile manufacturers can use these data when evaluating seat designs and occupant positioning.}

This study introduces a taxonomy of interactions to be used in association with the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM). The taxonomy has nine criteria: nature of agents, output nature, levelling, waiting time, distance, degree of coupling, visibility, safety and/or security hazards, and parallel replications. For each criterion, two descriptors are proposed: what the interaction looks like; and - when applicable - the variability level of the interaction. The use of the taxonomy is presented for three systems with clearly distinct complexity characteristics: cash withdrawal from an ATM, teaching a university course, and manufacturing operations. These case studies indicate the usefulness of the taxonomy for the identification of leverage points in work system design. They also show the value of modelling the variability of the interactions in FRAM models, in addition to the traditional modelling of the variability of the outputs of functions. Implications of the taxonomy for resilience engineering are discussed.}

Electromyogram signals for the flexor digitorum superficialis and extensor digitorum muscles were recorded. The syringe adapter required 31% of the 90th percentile flexor muscle activity as compared to the ring-finger syringe extension method, and 45% the 90th percentile flexor muscle activity as compared to the middle-finger method (p < 0.001). The greatest differences were observed when the syringe was near full extension. Although the syringe adapter took more time than the other syringe extension methods (1.5 times greater), it greatly helped reduce physical stress associated with repetitive, awkward syringe procedures.}

abstract = {Objective
Prolonged sitting, which is highly prevalent in office workers, has been associated with several health risks. The aim of this study was to evaluate the Dynamic Work intervention by determining its effect on total sitting time at the 8-month follow-up in comparison to the control.
Methods
This two-arm pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial included 244 office workers from 14 different departments of a large, Dutch insurance company. The Dynamic Work intervention was a real-life, worksite intervention that included environmental components (i.e. sit-stand workstations), organisational components (i.e. group sessions), and individual components (e.g. activity/sitting trackers). Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 4-month follow-up, and 8-month follow-up. The primary outcome was total sitting time per day, objectively assessed using the activPAL activity monitor at 8-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes included other total and occupational movement behaviour outcomes, health-related outcomes, and work-related outcomes. Data analyses were performed using linear and logistic mixed models.
Results
Total sitting time did not differ between the intervention and control group at the 8-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes also showed no difference between the intervention and control group at either the 4-month or at 8-month follow-up, with the exception of number of occupational steps, which showed a statistically significant effect at 4-month follow-up (but not at 8-month follow-up) of 913 (95% CI = 381–1445) steps/8-h working day.
Conclusions
This study evaluated the effectiveness of a real-life worksite intervention to reduce sitting time and showed little to no effect. This may be due to the relatively low intensity of the intervention, i.e. that it only involved the replacement of 25% of sitting workstations with sit-stand workstations. Future research should focus on the evaluation of more intensive real-life worksite interventions that are still feasible for implementation in daily practice.

Dual task paradigms are used to test the role of attention on motor performance. Usually the tasks used have little resemblance with every day experience. Here we ask: Does a common cognitive task, such as a mobile phone conversation, compromise motor performance on stairs? Eight young participants negotiated an instrumented seven-step staircase. Stair negotiation while talking on a mobile phone was compared to normal stair negotiation. Stepping parameters, jerk cost (measure of smoothness of locomotion) and step clearance were measured. When talking on a mobile phone, participants’ overall body velocity (mean(sd): Ascent 0.534(0.026) vs 0.511(0.024) m/s, Descent 0.642(0.026) vs 0.511(0.024) m/s, No phone/Phone respectively) and cadence decreased significantly (Ascent 75.8(5.8) vs 65.6(4.4) steps/min, Descent 117.4(4.2) vs 108.6(6.0) steps/min, No Phone/Phone respectively). Pelvis and feet jerk cost also changed significantly, mostly decreasing with phone use. Foot clearance did not show significant changes between No Phone and Phone conditions. These pilot results show that, even for young, healthy and cognitively intact individuals, talking on a mobile phone whilst negotiating a staircase induces measurable changes in motor performance. Participants moved slowly but more smoothly, reducing the motor control cost, possibly at the expense of movement accuracy. The reduction in motor performance is likely to be due to the difficulty in integrating the two sub-tasks. These results suggest that even young, healthy individuals show stair gait impairment when simultaneously negotiating stairs and performing another cognitive task, such as talking on the phone.}

This work proposes Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) as a formalized, team communication methodology for the analysis of content and flow, simultaneously, of naturalistic team communication in a structured environment. Several methods of analysis of team communication exist. Few of them, however, analyze the flow and content of communication simultaneously, and none with teams using naturalistic language. Team communication data is coded for flow and content (through speech acts), then turned into FCMs for visual and statistical analysis. Results show that when using the FCM methodology both flow and content of communication can be diagrammed at the individual level, however, when assessing at the team level, what is illustrated is the flow of content. The application of different statistical analyses to the FCM output provides the opportunity to answer various questions on team communication. This study demonstrates that by using speech acts (SAs) as nodes, FCMs can illustrate and analyze team communication flow and content for naturalistic language. The FCM methodology is a powerful tool for studying team communication, and further incremental work could advance knowledge in team communication dynamics and provide contributions to graph theory. This method provides a visual overview of team communication dynamics in a naturalistic language setting, thus allowing for the study of intra-team dynamics and inter-team dynamics simultaneously.}

Participants slept ∼7.5-h in all conditions. Upon waking, sleep inertia was quantified using the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale and Psychomotor Vigilance and Spatial Configuration Tasks, administered at 15-min intervals.

abstract = {Traction testing of footwear is expensive, which may create barriers for certain users to assess footwear. This study aimed to develop a statistical model that predicts available coefficient of friction (ACOF) under boundary lubrication conditions based on inexpensive measurements of footwear outsole features. Geometric and material hardness parameters were measured from fifty-eight footwear designs labeled as slip-resistant. A robotic friction measurement device was used to quantify ACOF with canola oil as the contaminant. Stepwise regression methods were used to develop models based on the outsole parameters and floor type to predict ACOF. The predictive ability of the regression models was tested using the k-fold cross-validation method. Results indicated that 87% of ACOF variation was explained by three shoe outsole parameters (tread surface area, heel shape, hardness) and floor type. This approach may provide an assessment tool for safety practitioners to assess footwear traction and improve workers’ safety.}

Of all the serving police officers in England and Wales 29.1% are female (Hargreaves et al., 2017). A survey was developed and then distributed by the Police Federation of England and Wales to all servicing police officers up to the rank of Inspector. The survey returned 2633 responses after cleaning of the data. From the responses it was seen that the predominant bra type worn is underwired (71%) and the predominant UK bra size is 34B (9%). It was also determined that the predominant areas where the body armour either rubbed or caused discomfort were the left and right anterior mammary regions and the posterior lateral sacral region. By understanding the distribution of bra size, type of bra worn and areas of discomfort or rubbing it helps further understand the issues faced by female police officers and how body armour design could be improved.}

An experiment was conducted in which 20 subjects performed a total of 3780 repetitions of a box-conveying task. This task included continuous sequential removing, carrying and depositing of boxes weighing 2–12 kg. The subjects' motion was captured using motion-capture technology. The origin/destination height was the most influencing predictor of the spinal and shoulder moments and the peak trunk, shoulder and knee angles. The relationship between the origin/destination heights and the above parameters was nonlinear. The mass of the box, and the subject's height and mass, also influenced the spinal and shoulder moments. A tradeoff between the moments acting on the L5/S1 vertebrae and on the shoulder joint was found. Compared to the models developed in similar studies that focused on manual material handling (albeit under different conditions), the high-order prediction equation for peak spinal moment formulated in the present study was found to explain between 10% and 48% more variability in the moments. This suggests that using a high-order equation in future studies might improve the prediction.}

This study measured the overall change in seated height and stature for crewmembers exposed to a microgravity environment. Seated height data were obtained from 29 crewmembers that included 8 International Space Station increment crew (2 females and 6 males) and 21 Shuttle crew (1 female and 20 males). The results indicate that all participating crewmembers experienced statistically significant change in seated height. The corresponding change, 6% from preflight, should be considered for vehicle designs as the necessary seated microgravity adjustment.}

The results of the study, including the repeatability, reproducibility and detectability show that the measurement method is appropriate for our purpose, although the reproducibility has to be improved by operator experience or by a more intuitive assembling of the measurement setup. An application example illustrates that the interaction of the seat components highly affect the resulting comfort relevant parameters. The question is whether this objectively recorded differences are also experienced by seat occupants, which is interesting to study in future research.}

To support caregivers, we need to conceptualize caregiving activities they perform, and the networks and roles through which they perform work. We performed a directed content analysis on interview data from twenty caregivers and applied a human factors approach to characterize informal caregiving work. Our results revealed 1) nuances in caregiving roles, 2) differences in caregiving networks, and 3) 13 categories of caregiving activities characterized by time commitments; physical, cognitive and socio-behavioral demands; and varying network dependencies. These findings can be applied in future studies to evaluate the needs of caregiving networks and how to better support them.}

The two feedback modalities have been used to provide information about incorrect neck and trunk posture. Ten healthy subjects have been involved in this study. Each of them performed 3D reaching movements with the aid of the robotic platform in three different conditions, i.e. without feedback, with visual feedback and with vibrotactile feedback, and a comparative analysis has been carried out to evaluate feedback effectiveness, acceptance and performance. Experimental results show that in case of no feedback the subjects reach and maintain configurations that can lead to incorrect neck and trunk configurations and therefore, if repeated, to musculoskeletal disorders. Conversely, with visual or vibrotactile feedback, the subjects tend to correct inappropriate posture with both trunk and head during task performing.}

Two main tools were applied in these studies: (i) the Technical, Organizational and Environmental (TOE) framework, focused on complexity; and (ii) the Resilience Assessment Grid (RAG), focused on resilience. Improvement opportunities were identified for existing SPMS. Also, a set of guidelines for the design of SPMS emerged from these studies as well as a model that explains the connections between the main constructs encompassed by the guidelines.}

abstract = {Cybersickness, i.e. visually induced motion sickness, remains as a negative effect that is detrimental to the user experience of VEs (virtual environments) developed for VR (virtual reality) consumers. As the VR technology evolves, it is rather triggered by application aspects rather than hardware limitations. For this reason, there is still a need for a measurement method to assess and compare VEs for cybersickness effects. SSQ (Simulation Sickness Questionnaire) is used for measuring users’ level of sickness symptoms and is highly appreciated in VR research. However, it is criticized for its psychometric qualities and applicability in VR, as a measure of cybersickness. Recently, two variants of SSQ were offered for measuring cybersickness, CSQ (Cybersickness Questionnaire) and VRSQ (Virtual Reality Sickness Questionnaire). There is also another variant with a different factor structure, which we call FSSQ, that is based on French translation of SSQ. Our study compares SSQ and these variants for their psychometric qualities; construct validity, discriminant validity, internal reliability, test-retest reliability and sensitivity to distinguish application aspects of VEs that are related to cybersickness. Using a within-subjects experiment design, we evaluated 7 different VEs with 32 participants through 9 sessions, resulting with 288 responses to the 16-item SSQ. Results suggested that both VRSQ and CSQ were valid and reliable measures of cybersickness, as well as being sensitive to application aspects such as translational and rotational movements required by users for navigation in VEs. Compared to SSQ and FSSQ; the cybersickness questionnaires, CSQ and VRSQ, revealed better indicators of validity. On the other hand, we assume that the development of the two cybersickness scales had limitations in sample size to represent VR consumers and limitations in stimuli to represent the applications aspects of consumer VEs. We suggest further evaluation of cybersickness symptoms with larger samples and broader range of applications to identify the symptoms and the construct of a subjective measurement tool.}

Although shaft stiffness and sole flexibility appear to be boot design features that could influence perceived comfort and plantar pressures, no study has systematically altered these boot design features to truly understand how they affect these parameters. This study aimed to systematically investigate the effect of changes to shaft stiffness and sole flexibility on perceived comfort and plantar pressures when 20 males walked on a simulated gravel coal mining surface under four different work boot conditions. There were no significant effects of shaft stiffness or sole flexibility on perceived comfort. However, shaft stiffness and sole flexibility each significantly affected the plantar pressures generated under the medial midfoot, heel, middle metatarsals and hallux and, in combination, affected plantar pressures generated beneath the lateral midfoot, medial and lateral metatarsals and lesser toes. Participants preferred a boot with a flexible shaft combined with a stiff sole, citing properties such as fit, moveability, walking effort and support to explain why they perceived one boot as more comfortable than another. We therefore recommend that underground coal mining work boots should be designed to incorporate different flexibility and stiffness between the shaft and sole of the boot to optimise foot movement and, in turn, walking efficiency.}

Illuminance at a given correlated color temperature was first maintained at the lowest value in the designated range and then increased in a stepwise manner. On reaching the highest value in the range, it was then decreased to the lowest value in a stepwise manner. The subjects were required to indicate their perception of brightness, glare, and comfort at the controlled illuminance levels. Electrocardiogram and electroencephalogram data were monitored continuously throughout exposure. The results showed that the boundary illuminances estimated from psychological and physiological responses did not significantly differ between male and female subjects, but differed markedly from those of fluorescent lights tested in a previous study. The high boundaries of the LED lights were higher than those of the fluorescent lights. The low boundaries of the LED lights at 3000 K and 4000 K were higher than those of the fluorescent lights, but the boundaries at 5000 K were lower than those of the fluorescent lights. These differences may be due to differences in the spectral distribution and luminance for a given illuminance between LED and fluorescent lights.}

abstract = {Objective
To ascertain the reliability of a standardised, short-scale measure of satisfaction in the use of new healthcare technology i.e., the LITE version of the usability metric for user experience (UMUX-LITE). Whilst previous studies have demonstrated the reliability of UMUX-LITE, and its relationship with measures of likelihood to recommend a product, such as the Net Promoter Score (NPS) in other sectors no such testing has been undertaken with healthcare technology.
Materials and methods
Six point-of-care products at different stages of development were assessed by 120 healthcare professionals. UMUX-LITE was used to gather their satisfaction in use, and NPS to declare their intention to promote the product. Inferential statistics were used to: i) ascertain the reliability of UMUX-LITE, and ii) assess the relationship between UMUX-LITE and NPS at different stages of products development.
Results
UMUX-LITE showed an acceptable reliability (α = 0.7) and a strong positive correlation with NPS (r = 0.455, p < .001). This is similar to findings in other fields of application. The level of product development did not affect the UMUX-LITE scores, while the stage of development was a significant predictor (R2 = 0.49) of the intention to promote.
Discussion and conclusion
Practitioners may apply UMUX-LITE alone, or in combination with the NPS, to complement interview and ‘homemade’ scales to investigate the quality of new products at different stages of development. This shortened scale is appropriate for use in the context of healthcare in which busy professionals have a minimal amount of time to support innovation.}

In this paper, we review different ways that the process component of the SEIPS models have been described and applied. We then propose the SEIPS 3.0 model, which expands the process component, using the concept of the patient journey to describe the spatio-temporal distribution of patients’ interactions with multiple care settings over time. This new SEIPS 3.0 sociotechnical systems approach to the patient journey and patient safety poses several conceptual and methodological challenges to HFE researchers and professionals, including the need to consider multiple perspectives, issues with genuine participation, and HFE work at the boundaries.}

(2014) developed a framework for mesoergonomic inquiry based on a set of steps and questions, the purpose of which was to encourage researchers to cross system levels in the studies (e.g., organisation-group-individual levels of analysis) and to explore alternative causal mechanisms and relationships within their data. The present paper further develops the framework and draws on previous work across a diverse range of sources (safety science, systems theory, the sociology of disaster and ethology) which has examined the subject of accident causation, levels of analysis and explanatory factors contributing to system failure. The outcomes from this exercise are a revised framework which seeks to explore what we term ‘isomorphisms’ and includes questions covering: (a) how internal isomorphisms develop or evolve within the system; and, (b) how these isomorphisms are shaped by cultural, professional and other forms of external influence. The workings of the revised framework are illustrated through using the example of the UK NHS Morecambe Bay Investigation (Kirkup, 2015). The paper concludes with a summary of ways forward for the framework, as well as new directions for theory within systems ergonomics/human factors.}

abstract = {Introduction
The period following discharge can present risks for older adults. Most research has focused on hospital discharge with less attention paid to on-going care needs. Despite evidence that patients undertake ‘invisible work’ to improve care safety, their reported willingness to be involved in care, and the consensus that successful transitions interventions include patient involvement, in reality, this is variable. Further, little research has viewed transitional care as a ‘system’, with gaps, interdependencies and variability across settings, nor the role of patients and families in supporting the system resilience.
Research objectives
1) model transitional care from multiple perspectives using the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM); 2) use the model to develop a theory of change to support intervention development.
Method
We drew data from two studies: i) exploring the perspective of older adults across transitional care, and ii) exploring how health services experience transitional care. We employed the FRAM to develop a model of transitional care, with a system boundary spanning an older patient's admission to hospital, through to thirty days post-discharge.
Findings
Modelling transitional care from multiple perspectives was challenging. 27 functions were identified with interdependencies between hospital-based functions and patient-led functions once home, the success of which may impact on transitions ‘outcomes’ (e.g. safety events, readmissions). The model supported development of a theory of change, to guide future intervention development.
Conclusions
Supporting certain patient-facing upstream hospital functions (e.g. encouraging mobility, supporting a better understanding of medication and condition), may lead to improved outcomes for patients following hospital discharge.}

Fifteen women performed cyclic assembly under four conditions differing in pace and organisation (line-type, batch-type). MV of trapezius muscle activity and upper arm elevation was quantified and partitioned into variance components. For all MV metrics, a non-zero between-subjects variance was found, indicating consistent individual MV traits across conditions. Variance between subjects was higher for electromyography (EMG) MV metrics compared with kinematic metrics. Our results showed individuals exhibited consistent MV traits across working conditions differing in pace and production process. Further research is needed to understand whether MV is an individual predictive factor for MSD onset or progression.}

An experiment was conducted in which 12 paramedic teams (each including two paramedics) performed in-situ simulations of a cardiac-arrest scenario. CPR quality was evaluated using five standard resuscitation measures (i.e., pre- and post-shock pauses, and compression rate, depth and fraction). The spinal loads while lifting, pulling and pushing the equipment bags were assessed using digital human modeling software (Jack) and prediction equation from previous studies. The results highlight where paramedics are currently choosing to position their equipment. They also demonstrate that the positions of the equipment bags affect CPR quality as well as the paramedics' work efficiency, physiological effort and biomechanical loads. The spinal loads ranged from 1901 to 4030N; furthermore, every occasion on which an equipment bag was lifted resulted in spinal forces higher than 3400N, thus exceeding the maximum threshold stipulated by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. 72% of paramedics' postures were categorized as high or very high risk for musculoskeletal disorders by the Rapid Entire Body Assessment. Guidelines related to bag positioning and equipment handling might improve CPR quality and patient outcomes, and reduce paramedics’ risk of injury.}

Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) have the potential to substantially improve safety by removing some of driver vehicle control responsibilities. However, a critical aspect of providing ADAS is educating drivers on their operational characteristics and continued use. Twenty older adults participated in a driving simulation study assessing the effectiveness of video-based and demonstration-based training protocols in learning ADAS considering gender differences. The findings revealed video-based training to be more effective than demonstration-based training in improving driver performance and reducing off-road visual attention allocation and mental workload. In addition, female drivers required lower investment of mental effort (higher neural efficiency) to maintain the performance relative to males and they were less distracted by ADAS. However, male drivers were faster in activating ADAS as compared to females since they were monitoring the status of ADAS features more frequently while driving. The findings of this study provided an empirical support for using video-based approach for learning ADAS in older adults to improve driver safety and supported previous findings on older adults’ learning that as age increases there is a tendency to prefer more passive and observational learning methods.}

Results show that females had significantly higher EMG root-mean-squared (RMS) values in the anterior deltoid than males when seated, but higher EMG RMS in the medial trapezius than males when standing (SBC ≤ 0.05). In standing, they also had lower values than males in the erector spinae. Overall, standing elicited less activity in the upper trapezius, wrist extensors and erector spinae than sitting.

In a within-subject design experiment, twenty participants inspected surface roughness of a manufactured component with and without exposure to priming on the display of an inspection logging system. The results show that the presence of primes impacted accuracy on surface roughness, cortical activities at parietal lobe P4, and eye gaze for inspecting components. The experiment provides supporting evidence that basic hacking of a worker display can be an effective method to alter decision making in inspection. The findings also illustrate that cortical activities and eye gaze can be useful indicators of cognitive hacking. A major implication of the study results is that physiological indicators can be effective at revealing unconscious cognitive influence in visual inspection.}

The ‘think aloud’ technique was employed and video and audio footage of their interaction with the vehicle was captured. Neisser's (1976) Perceptual Cycle Model (PCM) was used to analyse the data and three case studies are presented to highlight how poor synergy between driver and semi-autonomous vehicles can occur from the lens of Schema, Action or World information. Seven key design considerations are proposed to ensure a more positive and safer interaction between driver and autonomous vehicle to guide focus by manufacturers. Further evidence for the existence of a ‘counter cycle’ (Plant and Stanton, 2015) within the PCM is found and how this relates to the challenges of using verbal protocals expressed during a fast moving dynamic task is discussed.}

Passive seat designs can produce inadequate surface pressure zones on the body resulting in high musculoskeletal stress leading to physical discomfort. However, as proposed in this work, this can be alleviated by decentralizing the occupant's weight with an automatic morphing lumbar seat design. The morphing seat design presented in this paper adjusts in real-time, the seat's surface curvature to decentralize the pressure distribution. The seat system consists of a custom-made pressure sensor mat embedded within the backrest cushion and two pneumatic actuators located in the lumbar area. The purpose of this seat design is to produce a change in the backrest surface curvature so that such change creates a pressure distribution closely resembling a reference distribution. Said reference distribution is derived in this work based on the concept of the Ideal Pressure Distribution. The effectiveness of the discomfort reduction due to the decentralization of the backrest load is evaluated using an objective discomfort metric known as Seat Pan Distribution percentage applied only to the backrest, peak pressure areas and contact area. Preliminary performance tests of the seat system demonstrate the successful decentralization of the passenger's pressure distribution. The evaluation of the discomfort reduction is observed via the lowering in the objective discomfort metric and peak pressure areas while simultaneously increasing the contact area between the passenger and seat.}

In a laboratory-based study with a repeated-measures design, we played actual field-measured floor vibration profiles into a 6-degree-of-freedom motion platform to create different realistic WBV exposures: 1) vertical-dominant vibration collected from long-haul trucks, 2) multi-axial vibration collected from mining heavy equipment vehicles, and 3) no vibration (control condition). Circulating biomarkers of interest were cortisol and catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) to assess physiological stress, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) to test for inflammation, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) to measure oxidative stress, and myoglobin and plasma creatine kinase to assess muscle damage. We collected blood samples at pre-exposure (0 h), during-exposure (2 and 4 h), and 2 h into recovery after the WBV exposure (6 h) in all four exposure conditions. The results showed that a single, 4-h acute exposure to WBV may not be sufficient to induce skeletal muscle damage, inflammation or physiologic stress measurable in the blood. No significant differences were observed between conditions for any of the biomarkers that could be attributed to the exposure contrast between vertical-dominant and multi-axial WBV exposures. These findings further indicate known complications of WBV exposure likely arise secondary to chronic, repeated exposures that give rise to subclinical stresses that were not captured here.}

Individual variation in relative load carriage economy (ELI) was primarily assessed using standard deviation, coefficients of variation (CV) and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). There was large inter-individual variation in ELI values with highest mean CV's of 16%, 12% and 10% for head-, back- and combined front and back-loading.

To date, little is known about driver expectations of partial driving automation and whether this affects the information they require inside the vehicle. Twenty-five participants were presented with five partially automated driving events in a driving simulator. After each event, a semi-structured interview was conducted. The interview data was coded and analysed using grounded theory. From the results, two groupings of driver expectations were identified: High Information Preference (HIP) and Low Information Preference (LIP) drivers; between these two groups the information preferences differed. LIP drivers did not want detailed information about the vehicle presented to them, but the definition of partial automation means that this kind of information is required for safe use. Hence, the results suggest careful thought as to how information is presented to them is required in order for LIP drivers to safely using partial driving automation. Conversely, HIP drivers wanted detailed information about the system's status and driving and were found to be more willing to work with the partial automation and its current limitations. It was evident that the drivers' expectations of the partial automation capability differed, and this affected their information preferences. Hence this study suggests that HMI designers must account for these differing expectations and preferences to create a safe, usable system that works for everyone.}

abstract = {Activity-based Flexible Offices (AFOs) are innovations in workspace design that are being increasingly implemented in organisations. While most studies investigate satisfaction and perceived work support in AFOs, employees' workspace preferences are not addressed in the literature. The aims of this study were to (i) identify workspace preferences and non-preferences in AFOs, and (ii) investigate whether employees’ workstation choices support their activities and align with their preferences. Two Swedish municipalities participated in the study. Data collection involved 27 semi-structured interviews and annotations on architectural drawings. The results showed that the interviewees preferred workstations that were both desirable and functional, and avoided workstations that were undesirable. This was due to functional, social, emotional and symbolic aspects of the workspaces as well as their physical structure and stimuli. The approach used in this paper can be adopted for improving the design of AFOs, thereby mitigating the stress of finding a suitable workstation.}

Ten male subjects performed baggage handling tasks using confined (kneeling, sitting) and unconfined (stooping) lifting styles. Dependent measures of torso flexion and three-dimensional spinal loads were assessed with an electromyography-driven biomechanical model. Lifting exertions typical to airline baggage handling posed significant risk to the lumbar spine, regardless of lifting style. Statistically significant differences attributable to lift style (stooping, kneeling, sitting) were not observed for peak compressive, lateral shear, or resultant spinal loads, but lifting while kneeling decreased anterior/posterior (A/P) shear spinal loads relative to stooping (p = 0.02). Collectively, kneeling offers the greatest benefit when lifting in confined spaces because of the ability to keep the torso upright, subsequently reducing shear forces on the lumbar spine.}

A modified time-to-contact (TTC) method was proposed to evaluate postural stability during stair negotiation. Carrying unilateral loads required more rapid postural adjustments as evidenced by lower minimum ML TTC and ML TTC percentage as compared bilateral loads and no load during stair descent. In addition, lower ML TTC and TTC percentage were found for loaded limb stance for stair descent. Taken together, unilateral loads and the loaded leg during stair descent are of concern when considering postural stability during load carriage. These results illustrate differing postural control challenges for stair ascent and descent during load carriage.}

Forty-eight office employees (91.7% female, Mage = 39.8 ± 10.1) were randomized to receive a low-cost standing desk or to a control group. At 3-months, the intervention group sat 0.7 h (42min) less at work compared to the control group; F(1, 45) = 5.90, partial η2 = 0.12, p = .019. The effect was small, yet comparable to findings from studies using costlier alternatives. However, these reductions were not maintained at 6-months.

Although resilience in emergency management has been widely studied in many emergency contexts, the development of a new method to investigate actual resilient performance of the IMTs under realistic settings has been limited. To address such gap, this paper first introduces Interaction Episode Analysis (IEA), a novel approach to capture and describe emergent team performance. As an exploratory observation study, we apply the IEA to an information management aspect of the IMTs in two emergency exercises carried out in a high-fidelity environment. As a result, the IEA provides comparable sets of episodes as instances of work-as-done, rendering opportunities to further analyze essential elements of interactions between team members as well as information management activities. Moreover, the IEA enables comparisons between the observations and identification of challenges faced by the team in managing incident information and adaptive behaviors used to address the challenges. By gathering more evidences as well as addressing limitations identified in this study, the IEA is expected to serve as a method that facilitates the analysis of work-as-done of complex team work and the reconciliation between work-as-done and work-as-imagined to promote resilience in emergency management.}

The current research aimed to evaluate the success of an adaptation of this training for the UK context, along with investigating the impact of the presentation modality on RAPT effectiveness. Traditionally RAPT has been delivered on a PC monitor, which does not allow the same range of head and eye movements that drivers use when on the road. Thus, it was anticipated that the 360° field-of-view provided by Head Mounted Display (HMD) technology would provide a more ecologically valid experience, facilitating deeper processing and encoding of driving relevant scanning patterns, and an increased capacity to identify potentially hazardous areas of a driving scenario. Using a between-subjects design, three different training modalities were compared - a PC-based version using still images (PC-Stills), a HMD version using still images (HMD-Stills), and a HMD version using videos (HMD-video). All three training groups’ performance on the UK Hazard Perception test was compared to that of a control group, who received no training. Results indicated that the adaptation of the training materials for the UK context was successful, with all three training programmes leading to performance improvements in the RAPT tests. Although participants in the HMD-video condition required more attempts to pass the training, this group showed the greatest improvement in hazard perception scores from the pre- to the post-training tests. Results also showed scenario-based differences between the modalities, suggesting that the success of different versions of RAPT may be linked to the type of risky scenario being targeted.}

abstract = {Objectives
Investigate whether a range of cooling methods can extend tolerance time and/or reduce physiological strain in those working in the heat dressed in a Class 2 chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear (CBRN) protective ensemble.
Methods
Eight males wore a Class 2 CBRN ensemble and walked for a maximum of 120 min at 35 °C, 50% relative humidity. In a randomised order, participants completed the trial with no cooling and four cooling protocols: 1) ice-based cooling vest (IV), 2) a non-ice-based cooling vest (PCM), 3) ice slushy consumed before work, combined with IV (SLIV) and 4) a portable battery-operated water-perfused suit (WPS). Mean with 95% confidence intervals are presented.
Results
Tolerance time was extended in PCM (46 [36, 56] min, P = 0.018), SLIV (56 [46, 67] min, P < 0.001) and WPS (62 [53, 70] min, P < 0.001), compared with control (39 [30, 48] min). Tolerance time was longer in SLIV and WPS compared with both IV (48 [39, 58 min]) and PCM (P ≤ 0.011). After 20 min of work, HR was lower in SLIV (121 [105, 136] beats·min−1), WPS (117 [101, 133] beats·min−1) and IV (130 [116, 143] beats·min−1) compared with control (137 [120, 155] beats·min−1) (all P < 0.001). PCM (133 [116, 151] beats·min−1) did not differ from control.
Conclusion
All cooling methods, except PCM, utilised in the present study reduced cardiovascular strain, while SLIV and WPS are most likely to extend tolerance time for those working in the heat dressed in a Class 2 CBRN ensemble.}

Results provided further evidence that some accidental shootings may result from failures of response inhibition and that additional cognitive load is detrimental to overall performance. Future studies should explore the role of response inhibition in realistic firearm scenarios.}

The results of the study revealed that the four-finger, ergonomic pipette design reduced muscle exertion (25% reduction for aspiration and 35% reduction for dispensing), awkward wrist posture (33% reduction in wrist flexion, radial and ulnar deviation), and perceived discomfort in the wrist, hand and lower arm. Furthermore, most participants (9 of 10) who used a pipette in their daily work preferred the new pipette designs to a traditional thumb-push pipette design.

From a set of hypothesized contact points between the subject and the environment (ground and load), external forces were calculated as the minimal forces at each contact point while ensuring the dynamics equilibrium. Ground reaction forces and moments (GRF&M) and load contact forces and moments (LCF&M) were computed from motion data alone. With an inverse dynamics method, the predicted data were then used to compute kinetic variables such as back loading. On a cohort of 65 subjects performing MMH tasks, the mean correlation coefficients between predicted and experimentally measured GRF for the vertical, antero-posterior and medio-lateral components were 0.91 (0.08), 0.95 (0.03) and 0.94 (0.08), respectively. The associated RMSE were 0.51 N/kg, 0.22 N/kg and 0.19 N/kg. The correlation coefficient between L5/S1 joint moments computed from predicted and measured data was 0.95 with a RMSE of 14 Nm for the flexion/extension component. In conclusion, this method allows the assessment of MMH tasks without force platforms, which increases the ecological aspect of the tasks studied and enables performance of dynamic analyses in real settings outside the laboratory.}

The sitting period was either followed by an 8-min roller massage intervention or a controlled standing task. Results showed that muscle stiffness increased significantly after the 4.5 h sitting period. When the sitting period was followed by roller massage, the stiffness values dropped slightly below baseline stiffness.

Primary care is complex due to multiple health problems being addressed in each patient visit. Little is known about the effect of the number of problems per encounter (NPPE) on the resulting clinician workload (CWL), as measured using the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX).
Methods
We evaluated the relationship between NPPE and CWL across 608 adult patient visits, conducted by 31 clinicians, using hierarchical linear regression. Clinicians were interviewed about outlier visits to identify reasons for higher or lower than expected CWL.
Results
Mean NPPE was 3.30 ± 2.0 (sd) and CWL was 47.6 ± 18.4 from a maximum of 100. Mental demand, time demand and effort accounted for 71.5% of CWL. After adjustment for confounders, each additional problem increased CWL by 3.9 points (P < 0.001). Patient, problem, environmental and patient-physician relationship factors were qualitatively identified from interviews as moderators of this effect.
Conclusion
CWL is positively related to NPPE. Several modifiable factors may enhance or mitigate this effect. Our findings have implications for using a Human Factors (HF) approach to managing CWL.}

Much of the literature has tended to focus on activities within the train cab, placing the spotlight on “error” within the rail driving role; however a train is not propelled by a single person but by a team. This study set out to understand how network controllers perceive the relationship dynamic between the network controller and rail driver, and how these views shape system performance. Using a phenomenological approach underpinned by Joint Cognitive Systems theory, interviews were conducted with network controllers (N = 55) across 8 rail organisations in Australia and New Zealand to examine how they related to signals and to drivers. Sixteen different perspectives were identified ranging in type and varying by frequency, each with implications for coupling strength between the controller and driver roles and on system performance. Key dimensions of teamwork in train movement were emphasised, illustrating how the underlying values and philosophies in different network controlling cultures influence risk perception. The findings may be used to develop a more informed understanding of the ‘controller-signal-driver-train’ system and pave the way for strategies that can embrace diversity in different perspectives whilst optimizing system safety and performance.}

This simulator study aimed to investigate how riders perform an emergency braking maneuver in response to an oncoming car and, second, whether longitudinal motion cues provided by a motion platform influence riders' braking performance. Twelve riders approached a four-way intersection at the same time as an oncoming car. We manipulated the car's direction of travel, speed profile, and its indicator light. The results showed that the more dangerous the situation (safe, near-miss, impending-crash), the more likely riders were to initiate braking. Although riders braked in the majority of trials when the car crossed their path, they were often unsuccessful in avoiding a collision with the car. No statistically significant differences were found in riders' initiation of braking and braking style between the motion and no-motion simulator configurations.}

In the previous study (Ittianuwat et al., 2016), measuring five contact points of the back-backrest, including centre point (ISO 2631-1), was considered as an important factor for assessing occupant comfort in frequencies where seat structure resonances occur. To enhance occupant vibration comfort in the early seat design stage, predicting the dynamic response of the coupled human-seat system on various contact locations is necessary. In this study, a low order seated human body Finite Element (FE) model was developed for predicting vibration transmissibility of the human-seat system in frequencies up to 30 Hz. Throughout the optimization process, the parameters of the model were obtained by comparing measured transmissibilities of the occupied vehicle seat system. The human-seat system vibration modes were also compared and verified with measured data by calculating MAC (Modal Assurance Criterion). The results showed that two human body vibration modes coupled with foam were observed below 10 Hz, and two coupled human and seat structure fore-aft modes were observed at around 20.1 Hz and 21.9 Hz. Fore-aft transmissibility of the model at various locations of contact provided reasonable correlation with the measured data. The developed low order human model enables the prediction of the fore-aft transmissibility on various back-backrest contact locations up to 30 Hz. This showed the capability of improving occupant's vibration comfort by predicting transmissibilities of the human-seat system in the early stage of developing a new vehicle seat.}

The level of influence and social support at work were assessed by questionnaire. The exposure to OPA significantly varied by particular job type, especially in male predominant occupations. Overall, psychosocial job resources did not affect the exposure to OPA. These findings suggest that workplace interventions aiming to prevent adverse outcomes of OPA among blue-collars workers ought to focus on task redesign and target work organizational factors related to specific job type.}

We applied the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) process modeling method and identified nine dimensions of barriers and facilitators – anticipation, ED decision making, interacting with family, physical environment, role ambiguity, staffing/resources, team cognition, technology and characteristic of trauma care. For example, handoffs involving all healthcare professionals in the OR to PICU transition created a shared understanding of the patient, but sometimes included distractions. Understanding barriers and facilitators can guide future improvements, e.g., designing a team display to support team cognition of healthcare professionals in the care transitions.}

Regularity of balance, and measures of range and center of pressure distance, and gait measures of stride length and step width were quantified using sample entropy. When carrying 5% load, anterior-posterior balance became less adaptable relative to 0%. As load increased from 0% to 5%–10%, step width narrowed and variability increased significantly, indicating possible increased fall risk while walking. Healthy, young adults may be at an increased risk of falls when carrying a load due to a loss in adaptability in a dynamic workplace environment.}

The aim of the present study was to identify the most physically demanding work tasks for Swedish ground combat soldiers through the development and application of a questionnaire survey. This is the first in a series of studies aiming to describe the development process and validation of physical selection standards in the Swedish armed forces.
Methods
Based on procedural documentation, combat manuals and job analyses, a questionnaire was developed that defined and rated the perceived physical strain of 30 work tasks for ground combat soldiers. To assess validity, an expert focus group was used and psychometric analysis performed. The questionnaire was then distributed to 231 ground combat soldiers, of whom 165 responded (71%).
Results
The questionnaire was validated in three steps to achieve face and content validity, and internal consistency was acceptable (Chronbach's alpha ≥0.95). Of the 30 work tasks included in the survey, transport of wounded was rated as the most demanding task for both aerobic capacity and strength. Other highly demanding tasks for aerobic capacity included combat movement (low/high crawl), dismounted attack in close country, urban and rough terrain and carrying heavy loads. There were no gender differences for either aerobic or strength demands in the top five most challenging tasks based on proportions.
Conclusions
This study identified the most physically demanding tasks performed in the Swedish ground combat forces. Almost all the physically demanding tasks found in the present study contain elements of lifting and carrying, which require muscular strength and muscular endurance, with no gender differences.}

Grip strength and endurance were significantly (p < 0.05) impaired by ascents. With multiple ascents, toe clearance was reduced (Climb 1 – 0.0515 m; Climb 3 – 0.046 m), and participants reached higher with their arms (shoulder angle: Climb 1 – 117°; Climb 3 – 136°). NC demonstrated less range of movement through the hips (NC – 46°; EC – 58°), and higher muscle activation in the upper body (NC – 60%; EC – 49%). Experience reduced cumulative climbing times (exercise + rest), whilst maintaining the same physiological demand as NC and maintained optimised movement patterns for longer.}

Yet, it is challenging to make the best of both the philosophies in a period of knowledge transition when they may have to coexist. This work investigates how Safety-II may resemble, differ from, and correlate to Safety-I. From individual, environmental and organizational aspects, 9 impacting factors are identified and expounded comparatively in the two philosophies. To examine impact of the factors on accidents and resilience respectively, an empirical approach is presented in the context of Beijing taxi service system (BTSS). Multiple means such as questionnaire surveys, semi-structured interviews, and statistical analysis with bi-method (Correlation Analysis, and Data Envelopment Analysis) cross-checking are utilized comprehensively to support the empirical study. The results show that: a) individual factors play a dominant role in system risk/performance management, in respect to views of both Safety-I and II; and b) organizational factors are more influential in creating and maintaining system resilience. Based on the findings, possible patterns of integrating the two philosophies are instantiated through mutually complementary application to BTSS. Despite the context of BTSS, this work provides a feasible way of comparing between Safety-I and Safety-II, for beneficial reference of other socio-technical systems.}

Purpose
Compare the physiological strain of SCBACC to live-fire training (LFT) and circuit training (CT) among academy cadets.
Methods
Cadets wore physiologic status monitors to assess heart rate (HR) and estimated core temperature (ECT) during CT, LFT, and SCBACC of similar duration (33–38 min).
Results
Data from 52 cadet firefighters (28 ± 4 yrs old) were analyzed. ECT (38.6 ± 0.4 vs 39.3 ± 0.7 vs. 39.3 ± 0.6ᵒC), peak HR (182.6 ± 9.1 vs. 192.7 ± 9.5 vs 195.9 ± 9.6 bpm), and age-predicted maximal HR (APMHR%; 94.6 ± 4.6 vs 99.9 ± 4.9 vs. 101.5 ± 4.8%) were significantly (p < 0.05) lower for CT than SCBACC and LFT, respectively.
Conclusions
SCBACC produced physiological strain greater than CT and similar to LFT. SCBACC resulted in sustained HR at 100% of age-predicted maximal values, a peak ECT of 39.3 °C, and should be considered as physiologically stressful as LFT.}

We demonstrate the application of the decision ladder template and the skills, rules, and knowledge (SRK) framework to this new area of inquiry. Despite the high reliability of turbofan engines, accidents and incidents involving PSM still occur. During these unusual events, flight crew have not always responded appropriately, leading to a reduction in safety margins or disruption of operations. This article proposes recommendations for technological and information system that can support flight crew in responding safely and appropriately to a PSM. These recommendations focus on new ways in which information from engine health monitoring system and other sources of data can be utilised and displayed. Firstly, we conducted knowledge elicitation using Critical Decision Method (CDM) interviews with airline pilots who have experienced real or simulated PSM events. We then developed generic decision ladders using the interview data, operations manual, training manual, and other guideline documents. The generic decision ladders characterise the different stages of responding to PSM identified as part of the research. These stages include: regaining and maintaining control of aircraft, identifying PSM and selecting appropriate checklists to secure the engine, and modifying the flight plan. Using the decision ladders and insights from the CDM interviews, we were able to identify cognitive processes and states that are more prone to errors and therefore more likely to generate an inappropriate response. Using the SRK framework, we propose design recommendations for technological and information systems to minimise the likelihood of such inappropriate response. We conclude that this combination of methods provides a structured and reliable approach to identifying system improvements in complex and dynamic work situations. Our specific contributions are the application of these techniques in the unrepresented area of flight operations, and the development of evidence-based design recommendations to improve flight crew response to in-flight powerplant system malfunctions.}

abstract = {Introduction
The aim of this paper is to examine gender differences in the occurrence of accidents among workers while walking to or from their workplace (non-vehicle commuting accidents). We have previously found that the lower limb is more often injured at work among women, compared to men, so the paper concentrates on lower limb injuries.
Methods
Using the records of the National Institute for Insurance against Injuries at Work (INAIL), we focused on the non-vehicle commuting accidents of women and men recognized as work-related for the period 2013-2017. In particular, we examined the gender difference by work sector and type of trauma suffered with particular attention to lower limb injuries.
Results
The rate of non-vehicle commuting accidents (n. 60,936) among women was significantly higher than for men (1.29‰ vs 0.40‰ men, p < 0.001) for the period studied. Lower limb injuries (50.5% for women and 43.7% for men, p < 0.001) constituted the large majority of these injuries. In particular, dislocation of the ankle (78% for women vs 65.5% for men, p < 0.001), bruise of the knee (71.2% for women vs 54.9% for men, p < 0.001) and fracture of the foot (41% for women vs 33.6% for men, p < 0.001) were all significantly higher among women. The work sectors with higher injury rates were: Transport and Warehouse, Public Administration, Health and care services and Wholesale and retail trade. This result may be due to wear and tear from conditions at work. The women injured were on the average, a decade older than men (50-59 vs 40-49 years old).
Conclusions
Non-vehicle commuting represents an important, albeight neglected, preventable risk for women workers, causing lower limb trauma particularly at the ankle, the foot and the knee. These areas may be particularly injure-prone among women in specific sectors, due to the work environment. Effective prevention of these injuries requires gender-oriented ergonomic actions at work and in the commuting environment.}

But, electronic documentation systems are not without their share of problems. Accountability and liability requirements have made electronic information creation and documentation particularly challenging. Mandatory documentation requirements and templated electronic formats have increased the amount of information, but have not always resulted in reliable, useful, or meaningful information. Documentation systems have become rigid, offering little opportunity for healthcare providers to engage in meaningful conversations about the information, and to sense problem status without additional coordination. A particularly significant information interaction problem that we have identified from our field work in healthcare information modeling, which this paper focuses on, deals with what we term creator-consumer interaction behaviors. The purpose of this paper is to examine in-depth the problem of creator-consumer information interaction behaviors in electronic healthcare documentation systems. A creator-consumer interaction behavioral framework highlights satisficing behavior during creation and consumption of medical documentation, and the characteristics of the work system that may lead to satisficing on documentation tasks.}

The average microclimate temperature and relative humidity increased by 7.8 °C and 3.5% respectively after headset use. Overall subjective thermal discomfort increased along with duration of use and came primarily from the display. Applying the linear mixed-effects model showed that subjective thermal discomfort is positively correlated with duration of use, microclimate temperature, relative humidity and display coverage area. Conversely, thermal discomfort is negatively correlated with total coverage area, with microclimate temperature acting as the most significant contributing factor.

This study describes advances in the design of an Ambulatory Kidney to Improve Vitality (AKTIV), using an interview protocol during the early stages of product development to capture patients' and caregivers' reactions. The AKTIV has the potential to improve patients' quality of life and decrease mortality rates. The goal of our study is to examine patients' and caregivers’ design preferences and feature considerations for an AKTIV. We interviewed 22 participants (age M = 57.50, SD = 13.30), of whom 12 were female and 16 were patients. A pre-interview survey was distributed to the participants, and semi-structured interviews were subsequently held. The pre-interview results show that the belt and backpack designs were preferred over the shoulder bag and distributed designs. The participants also indicated on their pre-interview forms that safety and accuracy were more important to them than attachment ease, comfort, compactness, or operational simplicity. Invisibility and mobility were frequently mentioned when determining the strengths of each of the five design types during the interviews. Finally, individual differences in preferences for the various design types and attributes were identified. The results from our study have important implications for improving efficiency, effectiveness, and user satisfaction in relation to AKTIV prototypes and products. The findings from this interview study will help to ensure engineers and clinicians have target parameters for redesigning the AKTIV.}

This study examined the effects of rPPE on the development of fatigue of the erector spinae and trapezius muscles. Surface electromyography (EMG) was used to capture muscle activity, and both time domain (average rectified value) and frequency domain (median frequency) measures were considered in the assessment of localized muscle fatigue. Sixteen participants performed a simulated surgical procedure requiring intermittent 30° flexed static trunk posture with and without rPPE on separate days. The results showed that the rPPE condition demonstrated significantly greater (p < 0.05) downward shift in median frequency in the left lumbar erector spinae and left lower thoracic erector spinae consistent with task-induced localized muscle fatigue. Ergonomic intervention strategies are discussed.}

In a platoon system, one truck (semi-)automatically follows a lead truck with a reduced distance, which produces significant savings in fuel and enables better traffic flow. In a current application of truck platoon driving, the following vehicle operates at level-2 automation. Thus, the driver of the following truck merely has to supervise the semi-automated system, which takes over steering and speed control when engaged. Level-2 truck platoon driving had not been tested with professional drivers in real traffic before. We hypothesized that user acceptance would improve after the experience of platoon driving. Quantitative questionnaires and qualitative interviews were conducted with 10 drivers before and after an extensive Autobahn experience. The results show a clear increase of acceptance after the experience. Platoon driving was evaluated to be more useful, easier to use, and safer after the experience. Besides perceived driving safety, the prestige of truck platooning, the perceived usefulness of the system, and general technology affinity co-determined user acceptance.}

As experienced with other complex, sociotechnical domains, system redesign is anticipated to be more effective at improving safety than training-based solutions. In the outpatient care setting, complex tasks, conducted by a primary care provider, are provided for five macrocognition functions: sensemaking, re-planning, detecting problems, deciding, and coordinating. Redesigning systems could reduce delays to diagnosis by helping users to avoid missed symptoms, forgotten follow-up activities, and delayed actions. Health information technology could support resilience strategies by offloading documentation burdens, recording working diagnoses, displaying planned follow-up activities at the correct time interval, and supporting recognition of patterns in patient care. These insights suggest a path forward for future research on system design innovations to reduce diagnostic delays, and ultimately, reduce patient harm.}

abstract = {Background
Consumer virtual reality (VR) devices are becoming more prevalent in the market, but cybersickness induced by VR devices limits their potential application and promotion. Acustimulation has been found effective in reducing cybersickness symptoms. However, in previous forms, the more effective way of acustimulation is either intrusive or electrical which is hard to be applied to daily VR use.
Purpose
In this study, we aimed to find a both simple and more effective acustimulation approach, acupressure plus acupaste (AcP+) to reducing the adverse effects caused by cybersickness from VR applications.
Method
In this study, we set three conditions: acupressure plus acupaste (AcP+) (main condition of interest), acupressure with fake acupaste (AcP), and a no acustimulation condition (NoAcP). In AcP and AcP + conditions, we applied acupressure or acupressure with true acupaste on P6 point before conducting video-watching tasks using VR headsets, while in NoAcP condition, participants received no special treatment before video-watching tasks. We used questionnaires to measure symptoms of cybersickness and compared the results between these 3 conditions, especially between acupressure plus acupaste (AcP+) and acupressure (AcP) to examine the effect of AcP+, and compared AcP and AcP+ with NoAcP to confirm the effect of acustimulation.
Result
Participants reported significant fewer symptoms of cybersickness nausea feelings in both acustimulation methods, compared with NoAcP; and AcP+ was more effective than AcP against cybersickness on visual oculomotor aspect, and facilitated cybersickness recovery.
Implication
It would be promising to develop acupressure equipment and apply stimulation before VR application to reduce cybersickness.}

Situation awareness (SA), a critical component of forecast decision making, is commonly conceptualized as the degree to which information is perceived, understood, and projected into a future context. Drawing upon recent applications of eye tracking in the study of forecaster decision making, we investigate the relationship among eye movement measures, automation, and SA assessed through a freeze probe assessment method. In addition, we explore the relationship between an automated forecasting decision aid use and information seeking behavior. In this study, a sample of professional weather forecasters completed a series of tasks, informed by a set of forecasting decision aids, and with variable access to an experimental automated tool, while an eye tracking system captured data related to eye movements and information usage. At the end of each forecasting task, participants responded to a set of questions related to the environmental situation in the framework of a survey-based assessment technique in order to assess their level of situation awareness. Regression analysis revealed a moderate relationship between the SA measure and eye tracking metrics, supporting the hypothesis that eye tracking may have utility in assessing SA. The results support the use of eye tracking in the assessment of specific and measurable attributes of the decision-making process in weather forecasting. The findings are discussed in light of potential benefits that eye tracking could bring to human performance assessment as well as decision-making research in the forecasting domain.}

At this interim station lurks many dangers, there-among them issues surrounding the partial performance of the driving task. Despite their potential for increased safety, these systems come with many inherent limitations and caveats, and their safe use depend on drivers correctly understanding their new role. Training is proposed as a potentially effective method of introducing drivers to the central aspects in this human-automation interaction. A proof-of-concept training program designed to introduce drivers to a partial automation system was developed. The effects of training were then evaluated through a between-group mixed-methods simulator experiment. Results indicate that trained drivers both self-report and exhibit an improved understanding of the automation system. They also report a significantly higher inclination to retake control in critical situation, than do their untrained counterparts.}

Therefore, this study investigated whether older and younger users perceive the aesthetics of icon styles in the same manner as designers and which style results in the most efficient visual search. Using an experimental system that we developed, 24 older and 24 younger participants rated and searched application icons belonging to the two styles. The results indicated that there was generally a notable difference between participants' and designers' perceptions of icon design styles, even after training, and that the perceived icon design styles further influenced the visual search time and accuracy of the participants as well as their evaluation of the icons’ beauty. The results imply that the younger participants could use the skeuomorphic icons more efficiently than they could use the flat icons and that they had an advantage over older participants in terms of this ability; however, aesthetically they appreciated flat icons more. In contrast, older participants searched skeuomorphic icons more quickly and accurately than they did flat icons, and aesthetically they appreciated skeuomorphic icons more.}

The completion of studies using curved displays/screens has been neglected so far, despite their advantage of creating a more immersive and life-like experience. In two studies, we analysed possible performance differences between subjects' perceptual and attentional capabilities during a decision-making task whilst viewing life-size stimuli on large flat and curved immersive screens. In Study 1, participants performed an attention-demanding shape discrimination task. In Study 2, participants performed a more naturalistic football-specific discrimination task. Results of both studies revealed no differences in perception and decision making between screen conditions, but that attention can be directed across greater visual angles on immersive screens compared to flat screens. The findings suggest that attention can be directed across a larger visual angle on curved screens compared to flat screens probably because curved screens distort the image less than flat screens. This study has implications for the use of flat screens in studies that examine perceptual and attentional capabilities in the visual periphery.}

Participants completed automated driving in a driving simulator without a non-driving related task, with an easy non-driving related task, and with a difficult non-driving related task. The primary task was to monitor the environment and the system state. An N-back task and a Surrogate Reference Task (SuRT) were adapted to induce cognitive and visual loads respectively. The system followed a front vehicle automatically. Driving performance was measured by responses to a critical event (appearance of a broken-down car) after the automated system issued TOR and then terminated. High subjective difficulty of the N-back task was related to increased time and increased steering angle variance in the time course from onset of steering control to lane change, while high subjective difficulty of SuRT was related to increased steering angle variance in the time course after lane change. This suggests that both cognitive and visual loads affect driving performance after TOR in automated driving, but the effects appear in different time courses.}

Human-related and robot-related metrics were found to affect trustworthiness that subsequently affected trust. In particular, ability (as a trustworthiness facet) was a dominant factor affecting trust in HRI. Integrity was found to mediate the relationships between robot- and human-related metrics and trustworthiness. This study also showed a correlation between intelligence and trustworthiness, as well as between PAS and trustworthiness. The findings of the present study have significant implications for both theory and practice on factors and levels that affect trust in HRI.}

No associations were observed between the duration of smartphone/tablet use and symptoms. Baseline patterns of use (bout length, certain types of activities, multitasking) were associated with follow-up musculoskeletal symptoms.

A repeated-measures laboratory study with 20 participants (24.2 ± 1.5 years; 10 males) was conducted to compare biomechanical exposures (joint angle, moment, and muscle activity in the neck and shoulder), subjective discomfort, and task performance (speed and accuracy) during two VR tasks (omni-directional pointing and painting tasks) among different vertical target locations (ranged from 15° above to 30° below eye height). The results showed that neck flexion/extension angle and moment, shoulder flexion angle and moment, shoulder abduction angle, muscle activities of neck and shoulder muscles, and subjective discomfort in the neck and shoulder significantly varied by target locations (p's < 0.001). The target locations at 15° above and 30° below eye height demonstrated greater shoulder flexion (up to 52°), neck flexion moment (up to 2.7Nm), anterior deltoid muscle activity, and subjective discomfort in the neck and shoulder as compared to the other locations. This result indicates that excessive vertical target locations should be avoided to reduce musculoskeletal discomfort and injury risks during VR interactions. Based on relatively lower biomechanical exposures and trade-off between neck and shoulder postures, vertical target location between eye height and 15° below eye height could be recommended for VR use.}
