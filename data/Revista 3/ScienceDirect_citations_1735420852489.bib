abstract = {Recent advancements in 3D Human Pose Estimation using fully-supervised learning approach have shown impressive results; however, these methods heavily rely on large amounts of annotated 3D data, which are challenging to obtain outside controlled laboratory environments. Therefore, in this study, we propose a new self-supervised training method designed to train a 3D human pose estimation network using unlabeled multi-view images. The model trains relative depths between joints without any 3D annotation by satisfying multi-view consistency constraints from unlabeled multi-view videos without camera calibration, while simultaneously learning representations of multiple plausible pose hypotheses. For this reason, we call our proposed network a Multi-Hypothesis Canonical Lifting Network (MHCanonNet). By enriching the diversity of extracted features and keeping various possibilities open, our network accurately estimates the final 3D pose. The key idea lies in the design of a novel and unbiased reconstruction objective function that combines multiple hypotheses from different viewpoints. The proposed approach demonstrates state-of-the-art results not only on two popular benchmark datasets, Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP but also on an in-the-wild dataset, Ski-Pose, surpassing existing self-supervised training methods.}

In this paper, we introduce a simple, yet very effective graph convolutional network with skip connections for semi-supervised anomaly detection. The proposed layerwise propagation rule of our model is theoretically motivated by the concept of implicit fairing in geometry processing, and comprises a graph convolution module for aggregating information from immediate node neighbors and a skip connection module for combining layer-wise neighborhood representations. This propagation rule is derived from the iterative solution of the implicit fairing equation via the Jacobi method. In addition to capturing information from distant graph nodes through skip connections between the networkâ€™s layers, our approach exploits both the graph structure and node features for learning discriminative node representations. These skip connections are integrated by design in our proposed network architecture. The effectiveness of our model is demonstrated through extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, achieving better or comparable anomaly detection results against strong baseline methods. We also demonstrate through an ablation study that skip connection helps improve the model performance.}

However, the existing techniques are unable to provide high detection accuracy due to the inability of capturing the hidden features of brain tumors. In this view, the present work decomposes the MR modality images into different layers using non-sub-sampled shearlet transformation (NSST). Following this, the proposed detection pipeline employs adaptive pulse-coupled neural network (A-PCNN) module and a fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm for enhancement and segmentation of suspicious regions respectively. Interlayer textural relationships of tumors are estimated in terms of the layer-wise difference of the gray-level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM), similarity indices, and entropy distributions. Thenceforth, those feature coefficients are coded with binary sequences to express the textural homogeneity/randomness of tumors. Finally, these handcrafted multi-scale feature quantifiers are fed to some standard classifiers such as the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) technique, the linear square support vector machine (LS-SVM), and the decision tree (DT) for discriminating the state of benignancy/malignancy of tumors. Experimental results ensure that the proposed detection model shows superior performance compared to existing methods.}

In this paper, we make a further step forward to develop a novel CLIP-based metric, Semantic Similarity Distance (SSD), which is both theoretically founded from a distributional viewpoint and empirically verified on benchmark datasets. We also introduce Parallel Deep Fusion Generative Adversarial Networks (PDF-GAN), which use two novel components to mitigate inconsistent semantics and bridge the text-image semantic gap. A series of experiments indicate that, under the guidance of SSD, our developed PDF-GAN can induce remarkable enhancements in the consistency between texts and images while preserving acceptable image quality over the CUB and COCO datasets.}

In essence, a CLS model requires both translation and summarization capabilities, which presents a unique challenge, as the model must effectively tackle the difficulties associated with both tasks simultaneously (e.g., semantic alignment, information compression and factual inconsistency). Graph-based semantic representation can model important text information in a structured manner, which may alleviate these challenges. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Cross-Lingual Summarization method based on cross-lingual Fact-relationship Graph Generation (FGGCLS). Specifically, we first construct fact-relationship graphs for source language documents and target language summaries. Then, we introduce a cross-lingual fact-relationship graph generation method, which converts the CLS problem into a cross-lingual fact-relationship graph generation problem. This approach simplifies semantic alignment and information compression through the generation of graphs and leads to improved fact consistency. Finally, the generated fact-relationship graph of the target language summary serves as a draft for generating the summary, which enhances the quality of the generated summary. We conduct systematic experiments on the Zh2EnSum and En2ZhSum datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method can effectively improve the performance of CLS and alleviate factual inconsistency.}

abstract = {Long-tailed learning is attracting increasing attention due to the unbalanced distributions of real-world data. The aim is to train well-performing depth models. Traditional knowledge transfer methods for long-tailed learning are classified into feature-based horizontal knowledge transfer (HKT) and class-based vertical knowledge transfer (VKT). HKT transfers head-to-tail feature knowledge from different classes to improve classification performance when there are few tail classes. However, HKT easily leads to invalid transfer due to the deviation caused by the difference between the knowledge of head and tail classes. Fortunately, the class space has a multi-grained relationship and can form a multi-granularity knowledge graph (MGKG), which can be recast as coarse-grained and fine-grained losses to guide VKT. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical long-tailed classification method based on multi-granularity knowledge transfer (MGKT), which vertically transfers knowledge from coarse- to fine-grained classes. First, we exploit the semantic information of classes to construct an MGKG, which forms an affiliation of fine- and coarse-grained classes. Fine-grained knowledge can inherit coarse-grained knowledge to reduce transfer bias with the help of MGKG. We then propose a multi-scale feature fusion network, which aims to fully mine the rich information of the features to drive MGKT. Experiments show that the proposed model outperforms several state-of-the-art models in classifying long-tailed data. For example, our model performed 4.46% better than the next-best model on the SUN-LT dataset.}

abstract = {Multi-view subspace clustering (MVSC) has acquired satisfactory clustering performance since it effectively integrates the information from multiple views. However, existing MVSC methods often suffer from high time costs and are difficult to be used in real-life large-scale data. Anchor-based MVSC methods have been presented to select crucial landmarks to reduce time-consuming effectively. In addition, the processes of anchor selection of existing methods are performed in the raw space, in which the high-dimensional data often involve lots of noise information and outliers that inevitably lead to the degradation of clustering performance. Moreover, these methods also ignore the balance structure of data, such that the selected anchors cannot fully characterize the intrinsic structure information of the original data. To tackle the aforementioned issues, we present a novel MVSC method named Fast Multi-view Subspace Clustering with Balance Anchors Guidance (FMVSC-BAG). Specifically, FMVSC-BAG integrates the learning processes of anchors, anchor graphs, and labels into a united framework in embedding space seamlessly. This way, they can reinforce each other to improve final clustering performance while eliminating noise and outliers hidden in the original data. Furthermore, FMVSC-BAG constrains the learned labels to preserve the balance structure by a novel balance strategy to promote further that the intrinsic balance structure information of original data can be reserved in the learned anchors and anchor graph. Finally, extensive experiments on eight real-life large-scale datasets prove its efficiency and superiority compared to some advanced clustering methods.}

High quality KG is of crucial importance for many knowledge-based applications, e.g., question answering, recommender systems, etc. This paper studies the problem of entity alignment in KGs to promote knowledge fusion. Existing methods model the semantic representation of entities by using graph structural information or attribute information of the KG and then align the entities across different domains by calculating the distances between entitiesâ€™ embeddings. However, these methods only consider the node-to-node similarity in the alignment procedure while the edge-to-edge similarity is ignored. Our research hypothesis is that the graph edge alignment information is critical in entity alignment. We reformulate the knowledge entity alignment as a quadratic assignment problem (QAP) by adding relation alignment under the one-to-one mapping constraint. To solve the notorious QAP in a large-scale heterogeneous graph like KG, we propose a model, dual neighborhood consensus network (DNCN), which approximately decomposes the QAP into two small-scale linear assignment problems, i.e., entity alignment and relation alignment. After that, an edge-coloring propagation method is proposed to refine the coarse entity alignment result using the relation correspondence. Theoretical proof shows that this method can guarantee the isomorphism between local sub-graphs. The performance of DNCN is evaluated using the DBP15K and DWY100K benchmarks. Experimental results show that DNCN achieves the best performance on the DBP15K benchmark, and is computationally efficient. Ablation studies verify the importance of graph edge alignment information.}

In particular, there is a strong interest in performing convolution on graphs using an extension of the GNN architecture, generally referred to as Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvGNN). Convolution on graphs has been achieved mainly in two forms: spectral and spatial convolutions. Due to the higher flexibility in exploring and exploiting the graph structure of data, there is recently an increasing interest in investigating the possibilities that the spatial approach can offer. The idea of finding a way to adapt the network behaviour to the inputs they process to maximize the total performances has aroused much interest in the neural networks literature over the years. This paper presents a novel method to adapt the behaviour of a ConvGNN to the input performing spatial convolution on graphs using input-specific filters, which are dynamically generated from nodes feature vectors. The experimental assessment confirms the capabilities of the proposed approach, achieving satisfying results using a low number of filters.}

In this paper, we propose to trace the features generated along the convolutional layers via a histogram of local 3D invariant binary patterns, called deep tracing patterns. This leads to a highly discriminative yet robust global feature representation module. Building such a module into a CNN backbone, we develop an effective approach for texture recognition.

Transformer combines different responses and obtains the correlation between global features by self-attention. This paper proposes a lightweight hybrid network called Peak Search-based Convolutional Transformers (PSCFormer). First, combining the data characteristics of gas information, the Local Peak Search and Feature Fusion (LPSF) module is proposed to focus on the key gas features. Second, Transformer Encoder (TE) is proposed to obtain the global correlation between global features, and the parallel Convolution Encoder (CE) is proposed to capture the local dependence. Finally, a reasonable feature complementation mechanism is presented, and the preference of TE is alleviated for the slow-down response while solving the receptive field limitation of CE. This paper has evaluated three different datasets to validate the effectiveness of PSCFormer, all of which show stable and excellent performance with a good tradeoff between efficiency and complexity. The results prove that PSCFormer is an efficient and lightweight gas identification network, which provides a method to promote the engineering application of the e-nose system.}

In this paper, we propose a text-guided image inpainting method with multi-grained image-text semantic learning (MISL), consisting of global-local generators and discriminators. More specifically, we devise hierarchical learning (HL) with global-coarse-grained, object-fine-grained, and global-fine-grained learning stages in the global-local generators to refine the corrupted images from the global to local. In particular, the object-fine-grained learning stage focuses on the visual semantics of objects of interest in corrupted images by using an encoder-decoder network with self-attention blocks. Not only that, we design a mask reconstruction (MR) module to further act on the restoration of the objects of interest corresponding to the given textual descriptions. To inject the textual semantics into the global-local generators, we implement a multi-attention (MA) module that incorporates the word-level and sentence-level textual features to generate three different-grained images. For training, we exploit a global discriminator and a flexible discriminator to penalize the whole image and the corrupted region, respectively. Extensive experiments conducted on four datasets show the outperformance of the proposed MISL.}

abstract = {Leveraging unlabeled examples is a crucial issue for boosting performances in semi-supervised learning. In this work, we introduce the SAMOSA framework based on semantic augmentation for mixing semantic components from labeled examples and non semantic characteristics from unlabeled data. Our approach is based on a novel reconstruction module that can be grafted onto most state of the art networks. The proposed approach leans on two main aspects: an architectural component optimized to disentangle semantic and auxiliary non semantic representations using an unsupervised loss, and a semantic augmentation scheme that leverages this disentangling module to generate artificially labeled examples preserving known class information while controlling auxiliary variations. We demonstrate the ability of our method to improve the performance of models trained according to standard semi-supervised procedures Mean Teacher (Tarvainen and Valpola, 2017) MixMatch (Berthelot et al., 2019) and FixMatch (Sohn et al., 2020).}

However, previous works have primarily focused on representation using the entire graph or a single sampled subgraph, which fails to address the issue of noise introduced by prolonged ineffective interactions. Moreover, these approaches lack the capacity to model temporal information in an inductive manner, thereby limiting their ability to fully capture the evolving dynamic interests of users over time in a real world scenario. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a novel personalized inductive spatiotemporal graph neural network-based framework PistGNN. PistGNN extracts multiple temporal-aware subgraphs from userâ€“item pairs to avoid long-time gap meaningless interactions, which are then fed into a spatiotemporal graph neural network module. It is worth noting that PistGNN trains the model only by relying on subgraphs extracted from bipartite graphs, without depending on global information, and is therefore capable of predicting for new users or items. Finally, we propose an attention-based meta-learning method to personalize the aggregation of subgraphsâ€™ embeddings. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of PistGNN over both inductive and transductive baseline methods.}

To remedy the above deficiencies, we reformulate the destriping task and introduce a novel solution from the task decomposition view. It is broken down into auxiliary sub-tasks involving stripe mask detection, stripe intensity estimation, and HSI restoration, which greatly reduces the difficulty of solving such an ill-posed problem. Based on this, we adopt a sequential multi-task learning framework and propose a stripes location-dependent restoration network, termed SLDR, which integrates the distribution and intensity features of stripes to achieve accurate destriping and high-fidelity restoration. Furthermore, we design a stripe attribute-aware estimator and a weighted total variation loss function to capture the unique properties of stripes and adaptively adjust the restoration weights of striped and non-striped regions. Extensive evaluation and comprehensive ablation studies on synthetic and practical scenes show the effectiveness and superiority of our model and architecture.}

It has non-negligible impacts on the classifier performance and has drawn extensive attention in recent years. Borderline oversampling has been widely used in single-label learning as a competitive technique in dealing with class imbalance. Nevertheless, the borderline samples in multi-label data sets (MLDs) have not been studied. Hence, this paper deeply discussed the borderline samples in MLDs and found they have different neighboring relationships with class borders, which makes their roles different in the classifier training. For that, they are divided into two types named the self-borderline samples and the cross-borderline samples. Further, a novel MLDs resampling approach called Multi-Label Borderline Oversampling Technique (MLBOTE) is proposed for multi-label imbalanced learning. MLBOTE identifies three types of seed samples, including interior, self-borderline, and cross-borderline samples, and different oversampling mechanisms are designed for them, respectively. Meanwhile, it regards not only the minority classes but also the classes suffering from one-vs-rest imbalance as those in need of oversampling. Experiments on eight data sets with nine MLC algorithms and three base classifiers are carried out to compare MLBOTE with some state-of-art MLDs resampling techniques. The results show MLBOTE outperforms other methods in various scenarios.}

abstract = {Online portfolio selection (OPS) has received increasing attention from machine learning and quantitative finance communities. Despite their effectiveness, the pioneering OPS methods have several key limitations. First, price predictions are usually based on predetermined trends, which is inadequate for a fast-changing market patterns. Second, each asset is treated individually, ignoring the pervading relevance among the assets. Third, the risk terms are usually missing or inappropriate in optimizations. This paper proposes a novel OPS method, namely, the online low-dimension ensemble method, to overcome the limitations. Motivated by the stylized facts for the co-movements of assets, the financial market is regarded as a high-dimensional dynamical system (HDS), and a large number of low-dimensional subsystems (LDSs) are randomly generated from the HDS to extract the correlation information among the assets. The assetsâ€™ price predictions are first made using these LDSs and then aggregated to formulate the final prediction using ensemble learning techniques. Thanks to the particular merits brought by our predicting scheme, we also develop a novel high-dimensional covariance matrix estimation/prediction method for short-term data, efficiently assessing the instantaneous risk of the projected portfolios. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our approach obtains more accurate predictions as the correlation information is fully exploited. With the predictive instantaneous risk assessment, a more appropriate optimization problem is proposed, substantially improving the OPS setting and leading to significantly better investment performance. Therefore, this study develops a flexible and promising approach to learning fast-changing market patterns and demonstrates that the high-dimensional feature of the market is a crucial information source for financial modeling with short-term data rather than a barrier in the conventional sense. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets are conducted to illustrate our method further.}

abstract = {Medical data sharing across institutes is crucial to large-scale multi-center studies and the development of real-world AI applications but suffers from serious privacy issues. A promising solution to address this challenge is federated learning, which typically aggregates a global model from heterogeneous data spread across numerous clients without exchanging data. However, the traditional federated learning algorithm (i.e., FedAvg) merely aggregates the locally distributed models according to the amount of data on each client and lacks the consideration of data heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose a novel Federated Adaptive Reweighting (FedAR) algorithm for medical image classification. FedAR employs a flexible re-weighting scheme that can balance adaptively the contributions of the amount of data and the performance of the local model on each client to the weight of that client. Specifically, we allow the amount of local data to contribute more to the weight of each client in the early training stage and let the performance of the local model play a more important role in the late stage. We have evaluated the proposed FedAR algorithm against the locally trained model, globally trained baseline, and two existing federated learning algorithms on the ISIC2018 dataset and Chest X-ray14 dataset under the settings with a variable number of clients. Our results suggest that FedAR is an effective federated learning algorithm that substantially outperforms existing federated learning approaches.}

Our proposed architecture has the following four advantages: (1) it inherits the ability of the deep learning models to locate an ROI automatically while also using a principal curve approach to automatically fit a dataset center; (2) it takes advantage of a principal curve-based enhanced polygon searching method, which inherits the principal curve's characteristic to automatically approach the center of the dataset; (3) it incorporates quantum characteristics into a storage-based evolution network together to improve the global search performance of our method, which includes several improvements, such as a new quantum mutation module, a cuckoo search method, and global optimum schemes; (4) it incorporates a suitable mathematical model to smooth the contour of ROIs, which is explained by the parameters of a neural network model.

These news stories include hundreds of individual, time-dependent texts. Simultaneously, new technologies have profoundly transformed the way we consume information. The need to obtain quick, relevant, and digest updates continuously has become a crucial issue and creates new challenges for the task of automatic document summarization. To that end, we introduce an innovative unsupervised method based on two competing sequence-to-sequence models to produce short updated summaries. The proposed architecture relies on several parameters to balance the outputs from the two autoencoders. This relation enables the overall model to correlate generated summaries with relevant information coming from both current and previous news iterations. Depending on the model configuration, we are then able to control the novelty or the consistency of terms included in generated summaries. We evaluate our method on a modified version of the TREC 2013, 2014, and 2015 datasets to track continuous events from a single source. We not only achieve state-of-the-art performance similar to other more complex unsupervised sentence compression approaches, but also influence the information included in the model in the summaries.}

Previous works mainly focused on exploiting visual cues from RGB images, while depth images received less attention. However, depth images contain rich geometric attributes about the objectâ€™s shape, which are crucial for inferring the objectâ€™s pose. This work achieves category-level 6D object pose estimation by performing sufficient geometric learning from depth images represented by point clouds. Specifically, we present a novel geometric consistency and geometric discrepancy learning framework called CD-Pose to resolve the intra-category variation, inter-category similarity, and objects with complex structures. Our network consists of a Pose-Consistent Module and a Pose-Discrepant Module. First, a simple MLP-based Pose-Consistent Module is utilized to extract geometrically consistent pose features of objects from the pre-computed object shape priors for each category. Then, the Pose-Discrepant Module, designed as a multi-scale region-guided transformer network, is dedicated to exploring each instanceâ€™s geometrically discrepant features. Next, the NOCS model of the object is reconstructed according to the integration of consistent and discrepant geometric representations. Finally, 6D object poses are obtained by solving the similarity transformation between the reconstruction and the observed point cloud. Experiments on the benchmark datasets show that our CD-Pose produces superior results to state-of-the-art competitors.}

Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of feature fusion using convolutional neural networks, but these methods are sensitive to image misalignment due to the inherent deficiency in local-range feature interaction resulting in the performance degradation. To address this issue, a novel feature fusion framework of dual cross-attention transformers is proposed to model global feature interaction and capture complementary information across modalities simultaneously. This framework enhances the discriminability of object features through the query-guided cross-attention mechanism, leading to improved performance. However, stacking multiple transformer blocks for feature enhancement incurs a large number of parameters and high spatial complexity. To handle this, inspired by the human process of reviewing knowledge, an iterative interaction mechanism is proposed to share parameters among block-wise multimodal transformers, reducing model complexity and computation cost. The proposed method is general and effective to be integrated into different detection frameworks and used with different backbones. Experimental results on KAIST, FLIR, and VEDAI datasets show that the proposed method achieves superior performance and faster inference, making it suitable for various practical scenarios.

Existing video captioning methods usually ignore the relative importance between different frames when aggregating frame-level video features and neglect the global semantic correlations between videos and texts in learning visual representations, resulting in the learned representations less effective. To address these problems, we propose a novel framework, namely Global Semantic Enhancement Network (GSEN) to generate high-quality captions for videos. Specifically, a feature aggregation module based on a lightweight attention mechanism is designed to aggregate frame-level video features, which highlights features of informative frames in video representations. In addition, a global semantic enhancement module is proposed to enhance semantic correlations for video and language representations in order to generate semantically more accurate captions. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on two public benchmark datasets MSVD and MSR-VTT demonstrate that the proposed GSEN can achieve superior performance than state-of-the-art methods.}

Some studies investigate the use of cellular automata to analyze the dynamic behavior of networks and refer to them as network automata (NA). Recently, it has been demonstrated that NA is effective for network classification, as it employs a Time-Evolution Pattern (TEP) for feature extraction. However, the TEPs investigated in previous studies consist of binary values (states) that do not capture the intrinsic details of the analyzed network. Therefore, in this work, we propose alternative sources of information that can be used as descriptors for the classification task, which we refer as Density Time-Evolution Pattern (D-TEP) and State Density Time-Evolution Pattern (SD-TEP). We examine the density of alive neighbors of each node, which is a continuous value, and compute feature vectors based on histograms of TEPs. Our results demonstrate significant improvement over previous studies on five synthetic network datasets, as well as seven real datasets. Our proposed method is not only a promising approach for pattern recognition in networks, but also shows considerable potential for other types of data that can be transformed into network.}

In this study, the proposed Asymptotic Neural Architecture Search network (ANAS) achieved a proxyless search for large-scale tasks with economic and stable memory consumption. Instead of proxy search like other NAS algorithms, ANAS achieved the large-scale proxyless search that directly learns deep neural network architecture for target task.

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel framework of computing the Quantum-based Entropic Representations (QBER) for un-attributed graphs, through the Continuous-time Quantum Walk (CTQW). To achieve this, we commence by transforming each original graph into a family of k-level neighborhood graphs, where each k-level neighborhood graph encapsulates the connected information between each vertex and its k-hop neighbor vertices, providing a fine representation to reflect the multi-level topological information for the original global graph structure. To further capture the complicated structural characteristics of the original graph through its neighborhood graphs, we propose to characterize the structure of each neighborhood graph with the Average Mixing Matrix (AMM) of the CTQW, that encapsulates the time-averaged behavior of the CTQW evolved on the neighborhood graph. More specifically, we show how the AMM matrix allows us to compute a Quantum Shannon Entropy for each vertex, and thus compute an entropic signature for each neighborhood graph by measuring the averaged value or the Jensenâ€“Shannon Divergence between the entropies of its vertices. For each original graph, the resulting QBER is defined by gauging how the entropic signat ures vary on its k-level neighborhood graphs with increasing k, reflecting the multi-dimensional entropy-based structure information of the original graph. Experiments on standard graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed QBER approach in terms of the classification accuracies. The proposed approach can significantly outperform state-of-the-art entropic complexity measuring methods, graph kernel methods, as well as graph deep learning methods.}

To enhance the image features, we utilize the involution to provide rich features and model the long-range dependencies. In addition, we propose a Multi-Scale-Interaction module which utilizes the self-attention to make an interaction between the feature scales to avoid detail loss. Additionally, we propose a Motion-Features-Optimization block that utilizes the deformable convolution to enhance the motion features. Our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on Sintel and KITTI 2015 benchmarks.}

However, most existing work focuses on generating lip movements only without handling the closely correlated facial expressions, which degrades the realism of the generated faces greatly. This paper presents DIRFA, a novel method that can generate talking faces with diverse yet realistic facial animations from the same driving audio. To accommodate fair variation of plausible facial animations for the same audio, we design a transformer-based probabilistic mapping network that can model the variational facial animation distribution conditioned upon the input audio and autoregressively convert the audio signals into a facial animation sequence. In addition, we introduce a temporally-biased mask into the mapping network, which allows to model the temporal dependency of facial animations and produce temporally smooth facial animation sequence. With the generated facial animation sequence and a source image, photo-realistic talking faces can be synthesized with a generic generation network. Extensive experiments show that DIRFA can generate talking faces with realistic facial animations effectively.}

The presented method is a step towards humansâ€™ ability to detect when data contain a meaningful pattern. It also has similarities to theoretical ideas for measuring meaningful complexity. We conduct experiments on seven different sets of images, which show that our method assigns the most accurate scores to all images considered. Additionally, comparing the different levels of the hierarchy of clusters can reveal how complexity manifests at different scales, from local detail to global structure. We then present ablation studies showing the contribution of the components of our method, and that it continues to assign reasonable scores when the inputs are modified in certain ways, including the addition of Gaussian noise and the lowering of the resolution.

However, pixel-wise annotations are extremely expert-demanding and labor-intensive, but the performance of unsupervised learning methods are failed to meet the demands of practical applications. To achieve a reasonable trade-off between the performance and label dependency, a novel weakly supervised inpainting-based learning method is introduced, in which only bounding box labels are required for accurate segmentation. Specifically, lesion regions are first detected by an object detection network, then we crop them out of the input image and recover the missing holes to normal regions using a progressive CT inpainting network (PCIN). Finally, a post-processing method is designed to get the accurate segmentation mask from the difference image of input and recovered images. In addition, real information (i.e., number, location and size) of the bounding boxes of lesions from the dataset guides us to make the training dataset for PCIN. We apply a multi-scale supervised strategy to train PCIN for a progressive and stable inpainting. Moreover, to remove the visual artifacts resulted from the invalid features of missing holes, an initial patch generation network (IPGN) is proposed for holes initialization with generated pseudo healthy image patches. Experiments on the public COVID-19 dataset demonstrate that PCIN is outstanding in lung CT images inpainting, and the performance of our proposed weakly supervised method is comparable to fully supervised methods.}

Although several graph embedding based works have been designed and achieved promising performance, there are still some issues that need to be further studied, including, (1) one significant drawback of graph embedding is its expensive memory and computation cost caused by the graph Laplacian matrix; (2) most pioneer works fail to fully explore the available class labels in training procedure, which generally makes them suffer from unsatisfactory retrieval performance. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a simple yet effective supervised cross-media hashing scheme, termed Efficient Supervised Graph Embedding Hashing (ESGEH), which can simultaneously learn hash functions and discrete binary codes efficiently. Specifically, ESGEH leverages both class label based semantic embedding and graph embedding to generate a sharing semantic subspace, and class labels are also incorporated to minimize the quantization error for better approximating the generated binary codes. In order to reduce the computational sources, a well-designed intermediate terms decomposition is proposed to avoid explicitly computing the graph Laplacian matrix. Finally, an iterative discrete optimal algorithm is derived to solve above problem, and each subproblem can yield a closed-form solution. Extensive experimental results on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over several existing cross-media hashing methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.}

To address this issue, we propose a novel method for multi-label feature selection that accounts for both the strongly relevant label gain and the label mutual aid. Firstly, we advance two new potential relationships between labels and candidate features relative to selected features, and the label discriminant function is introduced. Secondly, the mutual aid information between labels is presented to describe the internal correlation of the label space. Thirdly, the concept of strongly relevant label gain is defined based on the label discriminant function, which allows better exploration of positive correlation between features. Finally, the experimental results on sixteen multi-label benchmark datasets indicate that the proposed method outperforms other compared representative multi-label feature selection methods.}

Without requiring additional labeled data, contrastive learning based graph representation learning (or graph contrastive learning) has attracted considerable attention. Recently, one of the most exciting advancement in graph contrastive learning is Deep Graph Infomax (DGI), which maximizes the Mutual Information (MI) between the node and graph representations. However, DGI only considers the contextual node information, ignoring the intrinsic node information (i.e., the similarity between node representations in different views). In this paper, we propose a novel Cross-scale Contrastive Triplet Networks (CCTN) framework, which captures both contextual and intrinsic node information for graph representation learning. Specifically, to obtain the contextual node information, we utilize an infomax contrastive network to maximize the MI between node and graph representations. For acquiring the intrinsic node information, we present a Siamese contrastive network by maximizing the similarity between node representations in different augmented views. Two contrastive networks learn together through a shared graph convolution network to form our cross-scale contrastive triplet networks. Finally, we evaluate CCTN on six real-world datasets. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CCTN achieves state-of-the-art performance on node classification and clustering tasks.}

Recently more attention is paid to design a model of count-aided VQA. Based on the questions, the VQA system responds with appropriate answers. Yet, the complex questions are necessitating in the system with answers. The earlier models are still facing the challenging problems of counting the various objects within the images as the models become futile to select the features and lack fine-grained representation. In order to sustain the image representation, this paper proposes a new model for VQA using the heuristic approach of serial cascaded deep learning methods. Initially, the standard data regarding images and text data are gathered and fed to the pre-processing process. Consequently, the feature extraction is done on both the image and the text data. Here, the deep features from images are taken using Visual Geometry Group 16 (VGG16) and the text features are extracted using Text Convolutional Neural Network (TCNN). Then, the optimal weighted fused features are obtained, where the weights used for getting the necessary features are tuned via the Improved Tuna Swarm Optimization (ITSO) algorithm. Finally, the counting answers are retrieved based on the given queries, which is carried out via Serial Cascaded Recurrent Neural Network with Attention Mechanism-based Long Short-Term Memory (SCRAM-LSTM). The performance is examined with divergent metrics compared with conventional models. Hence, the findings reveal that it offers superior performance in estimating the appropriate answers. Therefore, the proposed work is widely used for such potential applications as helping blind or visually impaired people to get information, integrating with image retrieval systems, and also for search engines. Especially, it is utilized for the vision and language systems.}

Extensive experiments are performed on the MS COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets with different backbones, confirming that the proposed method improves performance significantly.

Specifically, RER constructs a more robust and accurate graph by adaptively arranging the weight coefficient for each data point. Furthermore, the low-rank representation is introduced to reduce the negative influence of the redundant features and noises residing in the original data while the graph construction. More importantly, the proper norms are imposed on both the reconstruction and regularization terms to further improve the robustness and earn feature/sample selection.

Most existing methods utilized denoise modules to assist the detection network or exploit prior knowledge to reduce the environment interference remaining in the features, which ignores the essential role of the frequency element. From a novel perspective, we observe that the inclement environment alters the frequency content in the features, which in turn crushes the detection. To tickle this problem, we present the Magnitude Consistency Network (MCNet) to distill the irrelevant contents in the frequency domain. The MCNet is composed of the detection network and the magnitude corrector. The detection network is able to locate and classify objects. However, in inclement environments, the crucial information about the objects of interest is disrupted by the nuisance noise introduced from the inclement environments. The magnitude corrector can recover relevant information about the objects in the frequency domain by distilling the irrelevant factors and refining the affected features. Alternately optimizing the magnitude corrector and the detection network gradually makes the frequency content between the disturbed image and the clear image to be consistent. By distilling the irrelevant noise in the feature, the detection network can learn domain-invariant representations. Extensive experiments prove that the proposed method is effective and outperforms existing methods by a clear margin on four datasets.}

Despite recent advances, domain adaptation is still limited and is not yet practical. The most pronouncing problem is that the existing approaches assume source-target relationship between domains, which implies one domain supplies label information to another domain. However, the amount of label is only marginal in real-world domains, so it is unrealistic to find source domains having sufficient labels. Motivated by this, we propose a method that allows domains to mutually share label information. The proposed method finds a projection matrix that matches the respective distributions of different domains, preserves their respective geometries, and aligns their respective class boundaries. The experiments on benchmark datasets show that the proposed method outperforms relevant baselines. In particular, the results on varying proportions of labels present that the fewer labels the better improvement.}

Spatial inconsistencies are addressed via a depth-map estimation module that leverages an instance-specific kernel approach. To clarify the boundaries of facial components, we use category edge detection with a foreground attention module, generating generic geometric structures and detailed semantic cues. Our model is trained on two datasets, comprising individuals with regular smiles and those with one-sided facial weakness.

To solve these problems, this paper proposes a hierarchical multimodal crisis event summary generation model based on the modal alignment premise and hierarchical thinking. First, the visual context vector and text context vector are obtained, and then the hierarchical multimodal pointer model is employed to generate the text summary. Thus, the modal deviation is solved. Second, to select high-quality images, this paper proposes a dynamic selection strategy, which to some extent considers the requirements of the high correlation between text and images and the diversity of crisis information. Last, the experimental results based on the crisis event data in the MSMO dataset show that the proposed model achieves good performance in the summary generation and image selection of crisis events.}

However, relatively fixed graph regularization terms and loss functions have been adopted by recently proposed variants of NMF, and their clustering performance can be improved by incorporating configurable parameters. In this paper, an auto-adjustable hypergraph regularized non-negative matrix factorization (AHRNMF) algorithm was proposed. In the AHRNMF framework, we proposed a piecewise loss function and an innovative auto-adjustable hypergraph. The loss function incorporates two adaptive parameters, harmonizing reconstruction error and anti-outlier efficacy. Hypergraph construction relies on the calculation of two k-nearest neighbors (KNN) with different scales. Furthermore, an KNN-based algorithm was developed to assist AHRNMF in achieving auto-adjustment, which can automatically detect outliers without determining the number of clusters in advance. It was demonstrated by extensive experiments that the proposed AHRNMF outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.}

For number of methods proposed for hand gesture recognition (HGR); however, difficult scenarios such as different scales of hand gestures and complex backgrounds exist, making them less effective. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end multiscale feature learning network for HGR, which consists of a CNN-based backbone network, a feature aggregation pyramid network (FAPN) embedded with a two-stage expansion-squeeze-aggregation (ESA) module, and three task-specific prediction branches. First, the backbone network extracts multiscale features from the original hand gesture images. Furthermore, the FAPN embedded with two-stage ESA extensively exploits multiscale feature information and learns hand gesture-specific features at different scales. Then, the mask loss guides the network to locate hand-specific regions during the training stage, and finally, the classification and regression branches output the category and location of a hand gesture during the model training and prediction. The experimental results on two publicly available datasets show that the proposed method outperforms most state-of-the-art HGR methods.}

To overcome this weakness, in this paper, we propose a novel holistic-part unified model named TransOSV based on the vision transformer framework to solve offline signature verification problem. The signature images are first encoded into patch sequences by the proposed transformer-based holistic encoder to learn the global signature representation. Second, considering the subtle local difference between the genuine signature and forged signature, we design a contrast based part decoder along with a sparsity loss, which are utilized to learn the discriminative part features. With the learned holistic features and part features, the proposed model is optimized by the contrast loss function. To reduce the influence of sample imbalance, we also formulate a new focal contrast loss function. Furthermore, we conduct the proposed model to learn signature representations for writer-dependent signature verification task. The experimental results demonstrate the potential of the proposed TransOSV model for both writer-independent and writer-dependent signature verification tasks, achieving remarkable performance improvements and competitive results on four widely-used offline signature datasets.}

Specifically, we first propose a basic GNN-based framework (BGNN), which solely uses session-level item-transition information. Based on BGNN, we propose a novel approach, called Session-based Recommendation with Global Information (SRGI), which infers the user preferences via fully exploring item-transitions over all sessions from two different perspectives: (i) Fusion-based Model (SRGI-FM), which recursively incorporates the neighbor embeddings of each node on global graph into the learning process of item representation; and (ii) Constrained-based Model (SRGI-CM), which treats the global-level information as a constraint to ensure the learned item embeddings are consistent with the global item-transition. Extensive experiments conducted on three popular benchmark datasets demonstrate that both SRGI-FM and SRGI-CM outperform the state-of-the-art methods.}

For example, the CZSL model should recognize young cat when the model has seen images of a few state-object compositions like young tiger, old tiger and old cat. The visual features of a state may have significant variation across different compositions of the state with different objects. For example, in the compositions peeled apple and peeled orange, the state peeled has different visual features. This context dependency of state features is difficult to learn from the annotated images of different compositions. We propose a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) with two distinct branches for object and state recognition. GCN utilizes its ability to aggregate features from the non-Euclidean neighbourhood. This aggregation ability of GCN can help our model to capture the intricate dependencies between visual features of state and object. We also propose a novel cross-layer knowledge sharing strategy for the purpose of reducing ambiguity in learning state features due to context dependency. The proposed cross-layer knowledge sharing helps in identifying a set of objects having feasible compositions with a particular state and thereby reducing the ambiguity in the state features. Finally, we propose a feasibility based penalization to better regularize the joint prediction from the two branches of the network. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on the challenging benchmarks and competitive results in comparison to state-of-the-art algorithms have been achieved.}

Besides, to capture as much finger texture as possible, we utilize three-view finger images to reconstruct full-view multi-spectral finger traits, which increases the identity information and the robustness to finger posture variation. Finally, a Boat-Trackers-based multi-task distillation method is proposed to migrate the feature representation ability to a lightweight multi-task network.

With the emergence of new forgery approaches at an unprecedented rate, existing forgery detection methods suffer from significant performance drops when applied to unseen novel forgery approaches. In this work, we address the few-shot forgery detection problem by (1) designing a comprehensive benchmark based on coverage analysis among various forgery approaches, and (2) proposing Guided Adversarial Interpolation (GAI). Our key insight is that there exist transferable distribution characteristics between majority and minority forgery classes.11Majority class: class with abundant samples; minority class: class with scarce samples. Specifically, we enhance the discriminative ability against novel forgery approaches via adversarially interpolating the forgery artifacts of the minority samples to the majority samples under the guidance of a teacher network. Unlike the standard re-balancing method which usually results in over-fitting to minority classes, our method simultaneously takes account of the diversity of majority information as well as the significance of minority information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our GAI achieves state-of-the-art performances on the established few-shot forgery detection benchmark. Notably, our method is also validated to be robust to choices of majority and minority forgery approaches.}

However, the widely-used static trade-off between these two factors contradicts the dynamics of DNNs learning with label noise, leading to inferior performance. Therefore, we propose a dynamics-aware loss (DAL) to solve this problem. Considering that DNNs tend to first learn beneficial patterns, then gradually overfit harmful label noise, DAL strengthens the fitting ability initially, then gradually improves robustness. Moreover, at the later stage, to further reduce the negative impact of label noise and combat underfitting simultaneously, we let DNNs put more emphasis on easy examples than hard ones and introduce a bootstrapping term. Both the detailed theoretical analyses and extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method.}

The proposed method partitions the nodes of the graphs into clusters and then merges each cluster into supernodes. The motivation of this procedure is to reduce the computational cost of any graph comparison algorithm while maintaining the accuracy of the final classification. To assess the benefits and limitations of our method, we conduct thorough experiments on nine real-world datasets with different levels of graph reductions. The classification is obtained by four different graph classifiers (viz. a KNN based on graph edit distance, two SVMs based on a shortest path graph and a Weisfeilerâ€“Lehman graph kernel, as well as a graph neural network). The results indicate that we can reduce computation time by up to two orders of magnitude without substantially degrading the classification accuracy.}

Nevertheless, there lacks a theoretical analysis on how to reduce the generalization error during the learning process. To fill this gap, we prove that the classification error bound on novel classes is mainly determined by the base-class generalization error, given the base-novel domain divergence and the novel-class generalization error produced by an incremental learner using novel samples. The novel-class generalization error is further decided by the base-class empirical error and the VC-dimension of the hypothesis space. Based on this theoretical analysis, we propose a Born-Again Networks under Self-supervised Label Augmentation (BANs-SLA) method to improve the generalization capability of classifiers. In this method, cross-entropy and supervised contrastive losses are simultaneously used to minimize the base-class empirical error in the expanded space with SLA. Afterward, BANs are adopted to transfer the knowledge sequentially across generations, which acts as an effective regularizer to trade-off the VC-dimension. Extensive experimental results have verified the effectiveness of our method, which establishes the new state-of-the-art performance on popular few-shot classification benchmark datasets.}

Therefore, in this paper, we propose a heterogeneous network representation learning model based on role feature extraction, called HRFE(Heterogeneous Network Representation Learning for Role Feature Extraction). Firstly, we perform feature extraction for each node in the heterogeneous network to obtain a high-dimensional feature matrix, then perform role discovery using non-negative matrix decomposition techniques to obtain a role-based node representation, and finally verify the effectiveness of the model HRFE through experiments on a large number of real datasets.}

However, proxy datasets may not match the distributions of the original datasets of previous tasks. To address these problems in a setting where the full training data of previous tasks are unavailable and memory resources are limited, we propose a novel data-free distillation method. Our method encodes knowledge of previous tasks into network parameter gradients by Taylor expansion, deducing a regularizer relying on gradients in network training loss.

Current methods consider the same convolution operations for both shadow and non-shadow regions while ignoring the large gap between the color mappings for the shadow region and the non-shadow region, leading to poor quality of reconstructed images and a heavy computation burden. To solve this problem, this paper introduces a novel plug-and-play Shadow-Aware Dynamic Convolution (SADC) module to decouple the interdependence between the shadow region and the non-shadow region. Inspired by the fact that the color mapping of the non-shadow region is easier to learn, our SADC processes the non-shadow region with a lightweight convolution module in a computationally cheap manner and recovers the shadow region with a more complicated convolution module to ensure the quality of image reconstruction. Given that the non-shadow region often contains more background color information, we further develop a novel intra-convolution distillation loss to strengthen the information flow from the non-shadow region to the shadow region. Extensive experiments on the ISTD and SRD datasets show our method achieves better performance in shadow removal over many state-of-the-art methods.

In view of this, we propose a novel Bayesian Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning method, named BMARL, which leverages the distributional value function calculated by Bayesian inference to improve the robustness of the model. Specifically, Bayesian linear regression is adopted to estimate a posterior distribution concerning value function parameters, rather than approximating an expectation value for Q-value by point estimation. In this way, the value function is more generalized than previously obtained by point estimation, which is beneficial to the robustness of our model. Meanwhile, we utilize the Gaussian prior knowledge to integrate more prior knowledge while estimating the value function, which improves learning efficiency. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark multi-agent environments comparing with seven state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the superiority of BMARL in terms of both robustness and efficiency.}

abstract = {Nowadays, Multi-Label Feature Selection (MLFS) attracts more and more attention to tackle the high-dimensional problem in multi-label data. A key characteristic of existing gradient-based MLFS methods is that they typically consider two-way variable correlations between features and labels, including feature-feature and label-label correlations. However, two-way correlations are not sufficient to steer feature selection since such correlations vary given different additional variables in practical scenarios, which leads to the selected features with relatively-poor classification performance. Motivated by this, we capture three-way variable interactions including feature-feature-label and feature-label-label interactions to further characterize the fluctuating correlations in the context of another variable, and propose a new gradient-based MLFS approach incorporating the above three-way variable interactions into a global optimization objective. Specifically, based on information theory, we develop second-order regularization penalty terms to regard three-way interactions while jointly combining with the main loss term in regard to feature relevance. Then the objective function can be efficiently optimized via a block-coordinate gradient descent schema. Meanwhile, we provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating the effectiveness of the regularization terms in exploiting three-way interaction. In addition, experiments conducted on a series of benchmark data sets also verify the validity of the proposed method on multiple evaluation metrics.}

abstract = {In this paper, we develop an approach to exploit kernel methods with data lying on the m-D Kendall shape space. When data arise in a finite-dimensional curved Riemannian manifold, as in this case, the usual Euclidean computer vision and machine learning algorithms must be treated carefully. A good approach is to use positive definite kernels on manifolds to embed the manifold with its corresponding metric in a high-dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert space, where it is possible to utilize algorithms developed for linear spaces. Different Gaussian kernels can be found in the literature on the 2-D Kendall shape space to perform this embedding. The main novelty of this work is to provide a Gaussian kernel for the m-D Kendall shape space. This new Kernel coincides in the case m=2 with the Gaussian kernels most widely used in the Kendall planar shape space and allows to define an embedding of the m-D Kendall shape space into a reproducible kernel Hilbert space. As far as we know, the complexity of the m-D Kendall shape space has meant that this embedding has not been addressed in the literature until now. This methodology will be tested on a machine learning problem with a simulated and a real data set.}

The EWLA module adopts an expansion window mechanism to align local features extracted from the backbone with the same semantic meaning between photos and sketches. The LWF module assigns weights to each local feature of the sketch after evaluating their importance and fuses them to calculate the similarity between the sketch and photos for retrieval.

Firstly, a method exploiting the adaptive object detection method based on YOLOv8 is proposed to segment toothprints. Next, a novel geometric feature named calibrated offset distance is extracted, combined with the SIFT feature method, to extract multi-scale and multi-dimensional features from the global toothprint, local toothprints, and single-tooth prints. Finally, all features are aggregated to enhance the descriptive ability and robustness.

Although many methods have shown promising results, they often suffer from high time complexity and are not suitable for large-scale datasets. On the other hand, anchor-based methods are well-known for their efficiency. These methods typically learn the similarity relationship between instances and anchors and then convert it into the similarity relationship between instances, involving a considerable number of calculations. To address this issue, we propose a novel method called Multi-view clustering via Efficient Representation LearnIng with aNchors (MERLIN) in this paper. Instead of learning the instanceâ€“instance relationship, MERLIN approaches the clustering problem from the perspective of representation learning. Specifically, MERLIN selects the same anchors for different views and utilizes these anchors to learn a consensus representation that integrates information from all views. Additionally, MERLIN adaptively learns weights for different views to fully exploit the complementary information among multiple views. In comparison with seven state-of-the-art baseline methods across five datasets, MERLIN demonstrates both efficiency and effectiveness in handling multi-view datasets and is suitable for handling large-scale datasets.}

However, the Vision Transformer is unsuitable for high-resolution input videos due to the constraint of computing power since ViT splits frames into fixed-size patches embedded (i.e., tokens) with absolute-position information and adopts a pure Transformer encoder to model the relationships among these tokens. To address this issue, we propose a relative-position embedding based spatially and temporally decoupled Transformer (RPE-STDT) for action recognition, which can capture spatialâ€“temporal information by stacked self-attention layers. The proposed RPE-STDT model consists of two separate series of Transformer encoders. The first series of encoders is the spatial Transformer encoders, which model interactions between tokens extracted from the same temporal index. The second series of encoders is the temporal Transformer encoders, which model interactions across time dimensions with a subsampling strategy. Furthermore, we replace the absolute-position embeddings in the Vision Transformer encoders with the proposed relative-position embeddings to capture the order of the embedded tokens to reduce computational costs. Finally, we conduct thorough ablation studies. Our RPE-STDT achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple action recognition datasets, exceeding prior convolution and Transformer-based networks.}

abstract = {The multi-class classification task is one of the most common tasks in machine learning. As a typical solution based on a partitioning strategy, Error-Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) can transform a multi-class classification problem into multiple binary classification problems. The key of ECOC is to construct an effective codematrix to represent a set of class decomposition schemes, which transforms a multiclass problem into a group of binary class problems. Consequently, the design of a fast and effective ECOC codematrix generation method is of great research significance and value for solving multi-class classification problems. In ECOC algorithms, the design of codematrix is treated as a combination problem between different code columns, in which the evolutionary algorithm shows a great advantage. Based on this consideration, the Gene Expression Programming (GEP) is applied to search for the codematrix with high performance because its expressive tree structure makes it well represent codematrcies for subsequent optimization operations. This paper proposes an adaptive ECOC algorithm based on Gene Expression Programming (GEP) and similarity measurement matrix, named GEP-ECOC. In our GEP, each individual represents a set of columns to form a random ECOC codematrix, which is optimized in the evolutionary process. Meanwhile, the crossover and mutation operations are modified to include a legality checking process to ensure that the generated codematrix satisfies the ECOC constraints. The GEP-based ECOC codematrix generation algorithm can quickly produce a codematrix with better performance, which ensures the efficiency of the algorithm to a certain extent. In addition, an adaptive algorithm based on a similarity measurement matrix is proposed to add new columns to the current codematrix, aiming to better handle hard classes. Our algorithm is compared with other algorithms on various data sets, and the experimental results confirm that our GEP-ECOC can balance the efficiency and performance of the algorithm and achieve higher performance.}

Existing point cloud registration methods obtain correspondence point pairs by calculating the correlation between point features. However, the instability of point features makes the outlier rate of corresponding point pairs high, resulting in poor matching results, especially when facing low overlap point clouds. An obvious fact is that patch matching has higher reliability than point matching. To this end, we propose a patch-guided point cloud registration network. Specifically, we perform fusion on patches and points at both the feature and result levels to achieve the guidance of patch to point matching and improve the accuracy of predicted point pairs. At the feature level, we propose a Matching Pyramid Network (MPN) for multi-level patch/point matching. The core of the MPN is an attention-based cross-layer context aggregation (CCA) module, which is used for the fusion of matching features between upper and lower layers. At the result level, we design a matching consistency judgment module to ensure that the point pairs are consistent in the matching of each layer, which greatly reduces the outlier ratio. Based on the above design, the corresponding point pairs predicted by our network have a high inlier ratio, which makes our method perform well in the face of low overlapping point clouds. Extensive experimental results show that our method outperforms other existing methods for indoor and outdoor datasets.}

That number is unknown in real-world problems, and there might be more than one possible option. We develop a new cluster validity index based on a correlation between an actual distance between a pair of data points and a centroid distance of clusters that the two points occupy. Our proposed index constantly yields several local peaks and overcomes the previously stated weakness. Several experiments in different scenarios, including UCI real-world data sets, have been conducted to compare the proposed validity index with several well-known ones.}

abstract = {Multi-View Stereo (MVS) is a fundamental problem in geometric computer vision which aims to reconstruct a scene using multi-view images with known camera parameters. However, the mainstream approaches represent the scene with a fixed all-pixel depth range and equal depth interval partition, which will result in inadequate utilization of depth planes and imprecise depth estimation. In this paper, we present a novel multi-stage coarse-to-fine framework to achieve adaptive all-pixel depth range and depth interval. We predict a coarse depth map in the first stage, then an Adaptive Depth Range Prediction module is proposed in the second stage to zoom in the scene by leveraging the reference image and the obtained depth map in the first stage and predict a more accurate all-pixel depth range for the following stages. In the third and fourth stages, we propose an Adaptive Depth Interval Adjustment module to achieve adaptive variable interval partition for pixel-wise depth range. The depth interval distribution in this module is normalized by Z-score, which can allocate dense depth hypothesis planes around the potential ground truth depth value and vice versa to achieve more accurate depth estimation. Extensive experiments on four widely used benchmark datasets (DTU, TnT, BlendedMVS, ETH 3D) demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance and yields competitive generalization ability. Particularly, our method achieves the highest Acc and Overall on the DTU dataset, while attaining the highest Recall and F1-score on the Tanks and Temples intermediate and advanced dataset. Moreover, our method also achieves the lowest e1 and e3 on the BlendedMVS dataset and the highest Acc and F1-score on the ETH 3D dataset, surpassing all listed methods.

Our approach includes two training phases applied iteratively: first, the minimization of the internal energy, which captures dependencies between input samples and network parameters, is carried out in an unsupervised manner; second, the problem-dependent supervised external energy (e.g., cross-entropy loss) combined with partially reversed internal energy gradients are back-propagated in a standard manner. The intuition is that the first stage helps parameters to settle into the state that simply partitions data into clusters; while in the second stage, the network is allowed to deviate from that clustering a bit (hence gradient reversal) in order to converge to parameters that ultimately perform well on the task at hand. Notably, the data used for the two steps might not be one and the same (e.g., can come from different domains) and the approach naturally tailors itself to solve unsupervised domain adaptation problems without adopting any distribution alignment techniques. We also show that the proposed training strategy substantially improves the performance of several ConvNets on standard supervised classification tasks; showing improvements of at least 1.2% (2.64% on CIFAR-10, 4.5% on CIFAR-100, and 1.35% on ImageNet). Our formulation is general, performs well in practice, and holds promise for scenarios where labeled data is limited.}

These examples can lead to misclassification, posing a significant threat to the reliability of deep learning systems in real-world applications. Adversarial training (AT) is a popular technique used to enhance robustness by training models on a combination of corrupted and clean data. However, existing AT-based methods often struggle to handle transferred adversarial examples that can fool multiple defense models, thereby falling short of meeting the generalization requirements for real-world scenarios. Furthermore, AT typically fails to provide interpretable predictions, which are crucial for domain experts seeking to understand the behavior of DNNs. To overcome these challenges, we present a novel approach called Jacobian norm and Selective Input Gradient Regularization (J-SIGR). Our method leverages Jacobian normalization to improve robustness and introduces regularization of perturbation-based saliency maps, enabling interpretable predictions. By adopting J-SIGR, we achieve enhanced defense capabilities and promote high interpretability of DNNs. We evaluate the effectiveness of J-SIGR across various architectures by subjecting it to powerful adversarial attacks. Our experimental evaluations provide compelling evidence of the efficacy of J-SIGR against transferred adversarial attacks, while preserving interpretability.

For the negative pairs, to efficiently learn from the classes with high confusion degree w.r.t a query class (i.e., a class containing the query pixels), a new hard class mining strategy is presented.

In this study, the XCA image sequence is regarded as a 3D tensor input, the vessel layer is regarded as a sparse tensor, and the background layer is regarded as a low-rank tensor. Using tensor nuclear norm (TNN) minimization, a novel method for vessel layer extraction based on tensor robust principal component analysis (TRPCA) is proposed. Furthermore, considering the irregular movement of vessels and the low-frequency dynamic disturbance of surrounding irrelevant tissues, the total variation (TV) regularized spatialâ€“temporal constraint is introduced to smooth the foreground layer. Subsequently, for vessel layer images with uneven contrast distribution, a two-stage region growing (TSRG) method is utilized for vessel enhancement and segmentation. A global threshold method is used as the preprocessing to obtain main branches, and the Radon-Like features (RLF) filter is used to enhance and connect broken minor segments. The final binary vessel mask is constructed by combining the two intermediate results. The visibility of TV-TRPCA algorithm for foreground extraction is evaluated on clinical XCA image sequences and third-party dataset, which can effectively improve the performance of commonly used vessel segmentation algorithms. Based on TV-TRPCA, the accuracy of TSRG algorithm for vessel segmentation is further evaluated.

abstract = {Learning-based image inpainting methods have made remarkable progress in recent years. Nevertheless, these methods still suffer from issues such as blurring, artifacts, and inconsistent contents. The use of vanilla convolution kernels, which have limited perceptual fields and spatially invariant kernel coefficients, is one of the main causes for these problems. In contrast, the multi-headed attention in the transformer can effectively model non-local relations among input features by generating adaptive attention scores. Therefore, this paper explores the feasibility of employing the transformer model for the image inpainting task. However, the multi-headed attention transformer blocks pose a significant challenge due to their overwhelming computational cost. To address this issue, we propose a novel U-Net style transformer-based network for the inpainting task, called the sparse self-attention transformer (Spa-former). The Spa-former retains the long-range modeling capacity of transformer blocks while reducing the computational burden. It incorporates a new channel attention approximation algorithm that reduces attention calculation to linear complexity. Additionally, it replaces the canonical softmax function with the ReLU function to generate a sparse attention map that effectively excludes irrelevant features. As a result, the Spa-former achieves effective long-range feature modeling with fewer parameters and lower computational resources. Our empirical results on challenging benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed Spa-former over state-of-the-art approaches.}

abstract = {Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to recognize unseen categories without corresponding training samples, which is a practical yet challenging task in computer vision and pattern recognition community. Current state-of-the-art locality-based ZSL methods aim to learn the explicit locality of discriminative attributes, which may suffer from insufficient class-level attribute supervision. In this paper, we introduce an Attribute Subspace learning method for ZSL (AS-ZSL) to learn implicit attribute composition, which is more general than attribute localization with only class-level attribute supervision. AS-ZSL exploits subspace representations that can effectively capture the intrinsic composition of high-dimensional image features and the diversity within attribute appearance. Furthermore, we develop a subspace distance based triplet loss to improve the distinguishability of the attribute subspace representation. Attribute subspace learning module is only needed for the training phase to jointly learn discriminative global features. This leads to a compact inference phase. Furthermore, the proposed AS-ZSL can be naturally extended to adapt to the transductive ZSL setting using a novel self-supervised training strategy. Extensive experimental results on several widely used ZSL datasets, i.e., CUB, AwA2, and SUN, demonstrate the advantage of AS-ZSL compared with the state-of-the-art under different ZSL settings.}

abstract = {The findings on open-set recognition (OSR) show that models trained on classification datasets are capable of detecting unknown classes not encountered during the training process. Specifically, after trainig, the learned representations of known classes dissociate from the representations of the unknown class, facilitating OSR. In this paper, we investigate this emergent phenomenon by examining the relationship between the Jacobian norm of representations and the inter/intra-class learning dynamics. We provide a theoretical analysis, demonstrating that intra-class learning reduces the Jacobian norm for known class samples, while inter-class learning increases the Jacobian norm for unknown samples, even in the absence of direct exposure to any unknown sample. Overall, the discrepancy in the Jacobian norm between the known and unknown classes enables OSR. Based on this insight, which highlights the pivotal role of inter-class learning, we devise a marginal one-vs-rest (m-OvR) loss function that promotes strong inter-class separation. To further improve OSR performance, we integrate the m-OvR loss with additional strategies that maximize the Jacobian norm disparity. We present comprehensive experimental results that support our theoretical observations and demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed OSR approach.}

We demonstrate the threefold advantages of the self-supervised retrieval over supervised reconstruction on the largest visual-evoked EEG dataset with two evaluation protocols. First, it restores the exact visual stimulus without accessing the image class information, which was not possible with previous approaches. Second, it produces more recognizable results than generated ones and bypasses the challenge of training an image generator. Finally, it illustrates the benefits of self-supervision over supervised models in handling open-set data.}

Since the varieties of information of production workshop, making full use of the complementary information of RGB image and depth image can effectively improve the semantic segmentation accuracy of production workshop objects. Aiming at solving the multi-scale and real-time problems of segmenting the production workshop objects, this paper proposes Cross-Modal Transformer (CMFormer), a Transformer-based cross-modal semantic segmentation model. Its key feature correction and feature fusion parts are composed of the Multi-Scale Channel Attention Correction(MS-CAC) module and the Global Feature Aggregation(GFA) module. By improving Multi-Head Self-Attention(MHSA) in Transformer, we design Cross-Modal Multi-Head Self-Attention(CM-MHSA) to build long-range interaction between RGB image and depth image, and further design the MS-CAC module and the GFA module on the basis of the CM-MHSA module, to achieve cross-modal information interaction in the channel and spatial dimensions. Among them, the MS-CAC module enriches the multi-scale features of each channel and achieve more accurate channel attention correction between the two modals; the GFA module interacts with RGB feature and depth feature in the spatial dimension and fuses global and local features at the same time. In the experiments on the NYU Depth v2 dataset, the CMFormer reached 68.00% MPA(Mean Pixel Accuracy) and 55.75% mIoU(Mean Intersection over Union), achieves the state-of-the-art results. While in the experiments on the Scene Objects for Production workshop dataset(SOP), the CMFormer achieves 96.74% MPA, 92.98% mIoU and 43 FPS(Frames Per Second), which has high precision and good real-time performance.

abstract = {Channel pruning is broadly recognized as an effective approach to obtain a small compact model through eliminating unimportant channels from a large cumbersome network. Contemporary methods typically perform iterative pruning procedure from the original over-parameterized model, which is both tedious and expensive especially when the pruning is aggressive. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective channel pruning technique, termed network Pruning via rEsource rEalLocation (PEEL), to quickly produce a desired slim model with negligible cost. Specifically, PEEL first constructs a predefined backbone and then conducts resource reallocation on it to shift parameters from less informative layers to more important layers in one round, thus amplifying the positive effect of these informative layers. To demonstrate the effectiveness of PEEL , we perform extensive experiments on ImageNet with ResNet-18, ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3-small and EfficientNet-B0. Experimental results show that structures uncovered by PEEL exhibit competitive performance with state-of-the-art pruning algorithms under various pruning settings. Encouraging results are also observed when applying PEEL to compress the semantic segmentation model. Our code is available at https://github.com/cardwing/Codes-for-PEEL.}

Despite recent advances in accuracy in CSLR, state-of-the-art CSLR methods typically require large amounts of computations and memory occupation, which are not friendly towards fast inference under limited computation/memory budgets. Based on a simple observation that not all frames are equally important for CSLR, we propose AdaSize to handle this problem by modeling the frame resolution decision as an end-to-end learnable task to save unnecessary computations. Specifically, a lightweight 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) is first used to quickly browse input frames under a low resolution (e.g., 112 Ã— 112). These extracted coarse and cheap features are sent into a recurrent policy network to dynamically determine the desired resolution for each frame. Once the optimal resolution for each frame is decided, frames with different resolutions are fed into the following backbones to extract representative features. Finally, these features pass through a sequence of temporal modules and a classifier to predict sentences. Extensive experiments on four large-scale datasets, including PHOENIX14, PHOENIX14-T, CSL-Daily and CSL, demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaSize. AdaSize could consistently achieve comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art CSLR methods, with only 0.38Ã— computations, 0.41Ã— memory usage and 1.25Ã— throughput. Comparisons with commonly-used lightweight backbones and other efficient methods verify the superiority of AdaSize under similar computational/memory budgets. We finally plot the frame resolution decisions for AdaSize, hoping to provide insightful analysis of the inherent spatial redundancy in videos.}

abstract = {The localization of the camera is essential in AR, MR, and robotics. Diverse pipelines employ a hand-crafted or learning based way to predict the camera pose as per the task. In the localization process, both weaknesses and strengths are maintained. However, few current frameworks consider these two features simultaneously. In this study, a novel relocalization pipeline for RGB or RGB-D input is proposed, including a coarse stage with learned features, further refinement with hand-crafted features, and a stable process to measure the confidence of both stages for improving localization robustness. Instead of directly regressing the camera pose, the coarse procedure uses registration to the known source and predicted weighted target point cloud to obtain the initial result. Therefore, we design a deep network called PGNet to construct the weighted target point cloud with the image and previous poses as inputs. Moreover, in consideration of dynamic surroundings, we add a segmentation branch distinguishing each point as either fixed or dynamic with the purpose of promoting dynamic perception. Correspondingly, the segmentation-extended Chamfer Distance is added to optimize PGNet. During the pose refinement, the feature space is established via hand-crafted feature extraction and matching on the training set. Based on the coarse pose, we obtain the accurate pose by applying Kabsch or Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm to point-to-point correspondences built through searching the space and matching Oriented Fast and Rotated Brief (ORB) features. Furthermore, an additional process is presented by defining coarse and refinement metrics to gain a more stable performance. Finally, experiments on both static and dynamic scenes are conducted. On the one side, the results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance over other existing methods on 7 Scenes, INDOOR-6, Cambridge Landmarks and TUM RGB-D. On the other side, the positive effects of the pose learning part, dynamic branch, confidence regression and hand-crafted feature based refinement are also provided.}

abstract = {With the explosive growth of online information, the significant application value of recommender systems has received considerable attention. Since userâ€“item interactions can naturally fit into graph structure data, graph neural networks (GNNs), by virtue of their strong ability in graph representation learning, have become the new state-of-the-art approach to recommender systems. Recently, GNN-based contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) methods have received careful attention due to their superiority over graph-based recommendation under the typical supervised learning paradigm. However, to achieve state-of-the-art performance, GNN-based recommendation with SSL often needs a huge amount of negative examples and the modelâ€™s performance is heavily dependent on complex data augmentations. Also, the information interaction among various augmented views is often performed under a single perspective (e.g., structure/feature space or node/graph level). In this paper, we propose a novel bootstrapped graph representation learning with local and global regularization for recommendation, i.e., BLoG, which constructs positive/negative pairs based on the aggregated node features by referring to two alternate views of the original userâ€“item graph structure. In particular, BLoG learns userâ€“item representations by encoding two augmented versions of a userâ€“item bipartite graph using two separate encoders: an online encoder and a target encoder. To facilitate the information interaction between these two distinct graph encoders, we introduce local and global regularization for recommendation, where a graph structural contrastive loss and a node-level semantic loss are defined for local regularization while a graph-level contrastive loss is used for global regularization. An alternative optimization approach is used to train the online encoder and the target encoder. Experimental studies on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that BLoG achieves better recommendation accuracy than several existing baselines.}

abstract = {Deep sequential networks have shown great power in time series regression and classification. So far, most approaches naturally assume that the time sequential data are uniformly sampled. In practice, however, different variables usually have different sampling rates, thereby forming multi-rate time series (MR-TS). Particularly, the target variable (i.e., label) to be predicted usually has a lower sampling frequency due to the difficulty of manual annotations. The multi-rate problem poses two challenges. One is the diverse dynamics at different sampling rates, which is defined as multi-scale dynamics. The other is label scarcity. To tackle the above obstacles, this paper developed a Multi-scale Self-supervised Representation Learning technique with a Temporal Alignment mechanism (MSRL-TA) as a coherent framework. Concretely, a probabilistic masked autoencoding approach is pertinently developed, in which segment-wise masking schemes and rate-aware positional encodings are devised to enable the characterization of multi-scale temporal dynamics. In the course of pre-training, the encoder networks are able to generate rich and holistic representations of multi-rate data, thereby alleviating the label scarcity issue for supervised fine-tuning. Furthermore, a Temporal Alignment mechanism is devised to refine synthesized features for dynamic predictive modeling through feature block division and block-wise convolution. With empirical evaluation through extensive experiments, our proposed MSRL-TA achieved consistent state-of-the-art in both multi-rate time series regression and classification tasks on five real-world datasets, including air quality prediction, industrial soft sensing, human activity recognition, and speech voice classification.}

Various visualization approaches have been proposed to estimate the part of input which is relevant to a specific model prediction. However, most approaches require model structure and parameter details in order to obtain the visualization results, and in general much effort is required to adapt each approach to multiple types of tasks particularly when model backbone and input format change over tasks. In this study, a simple yet effective visualization framework called PAMI is proposed based on the observation that deep learning models often aggregate features from local regions for model predictions. The basic idea is to mask majority of the input and use the corresponding model output as the relative contribution of the preserved input part to the original model prediction. For each input, since only a set of model outputs are collected and aggregated, PAMI does not require any model detail and can be applied to various prediction tasks with different model backbones and input formats. Extensive experiments on multiple tasks confirm the proposed method performs better than existing visualization approaches in more precisely finding class-specific input regions, and when applied to different model backbones and input formats.

In this study, the unsupervised decision tree model is introduced into the evidential clustering framework to improve the interpretability of the evidential partition. A Decision Tree-based Evidential Clustering (DTEC) algorithm is developed to build an unsupervised evidential decision tree, which uses the paths from the root node to leaf nodes to achieve the interpretability of each cluster. The proposed algorithm is composed of three procedures, i.e., cutting-point selection, node evidential splitting, and cluster adjustment, in which the first two procedures are carried out iteratively to build a preliminary unsupervised decision tree and the last procedure is designed to adjust the preliminary decision tree if the number of clusters is available. Both synthetic and real datasets are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, and the experimental results demonstrate the good performance of the proposal compared with some representative fuzzy, evidential or decision tree-based clustering algorithms.}
