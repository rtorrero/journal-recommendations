abstract = {We propose a test-time adaptation for 6D object pose tracking that learns to adapt a pre-trained model to track the 6D pose of novel objects. We consider the problem of 6D object pose tracking as a 3D keypoint detection and matching task and present a model that extracts 3D keypoints. Given an RGB-D image and the mask of a target object for each frame, the proposed model consists of the self- and cross-attention modules to produce the features that aggregate the information within and across frames, respectively. By using the keypoints detected from the features for each frame, we estimate the pose changes between two frames, which enables 6D pose tracking when the 6D pose of a target object in the initial frame is given. Our model is first trained in a source domain, a category-level tracking dataset where the ground truth 6D pose of the object is available. To deploy this pre-trained model to track novel objects, we present a test-time adaptation strategy that trains the model to adapt to the target novel object by self-supervised learning. Given an RGB-D video sequence of the novel object, the proposed self-supervised losses encourage the model to estimate the 6D pose changes that can keep the photometric and geometric consistency of the object. We validate our method on the NOCS-REAL275 dataset and our collected dataset, and the results show the advantages of tracking novel objects.

abstract = {The field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has witnessed significant advancements in recent years. However, the majority of progress has been concentrated in the domains of computer vision and natural language processing. For time series data, where the input itself is often not interpretable, dedicated XAI research is scarce. In this work, we put forward a virtual inspection layer for transforming the time series to an interpretable representation and allows to propagate relevance attributions to this representation via local XAI methods. In this way, we extend the applicability of XAI methods to domains (e.g. speech) where the input is only interpretable after a transformation. In this work, we focus on the Fourier Transform which, is prominently applied in the preprocessing of time series, with Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) and refer to our method as DFT-LRP. We demonstrate the usefulness of DFT-LRP in various time series classification settings like audio and medical data. We showcase how DFT-LRP reveals differences in the classification strategies of models trained in different domains (e.g., time vs. frequency domain) or helps to discover how models act on spurious correlations in the data.}

abstract = {Labeling a sample in label distribution learning is highly expensive because it involves several labels at the same time and also requires assigning an exact value as the significance of each label. Therefore, active learning, which lowers the labeling cost by actively querying the labels of the most useful data, becomes especially critical for label distribution learning. Most of the known active query algorithms are for multi-label learning, and applying them directly to label distribution learning will lose some key supervisory information and thus fail to yield satisfactory experimental results. In this paper, we propose a sample diversity selection strategy based on the label distribution morphology, which can select diverse samples with different distribution morphologies from a large number of unlabeled samples for active querying. First, we use the feature space to construct a dissimilarity matrix that describes the pairwise dissimilarity among the unlabeled samples in order to pick a subset of samples that are representative of the unlabeled dataset. Second, using the information about the label distribution morphologies provided by the predicted labels of the unlabeled samples, we design a diversity loss score for each unlabeled sample. This score reflects the degree of difference between the sample and the labeled training sample. Finally, we use a convex optimization method to select valuable samples that are diverse from the labeled samples and represent the distribution of the unlabeled samples. The results of the comparison experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.}

Existing methods for graph meta-learning usually leverage local subgraphs to transfer subgraph-specific information. However, they inherently face the challenge of imbalanced subgraphs due to inconsistent node density and different label distributions over local subgraphs. This paper proposes an adaptive graph meta-learning framework (AG-Meta) for learning the consistent and transferable representation of a graph in a way that can adapt to imbalanced subgraphs. Specifically, AG-Meta first learns the structural representation of subgraphs with various degrees using an Adaptive Graph Cascade Diffusion Network (AGCDN). AG-Meta then employs a prototype-consistency classifier to produce more accurate transferable inductive representations (also called prototypes) under few-shot settings with different label distributions of a subgraph. In the context of optimizing a model-agnostic meta-learner, a novel metric loss is finally introduced to achieve structural representation and prototype consistency. Extensive experiments are conducted to compare AG-Meta against baselines on five real-world networks, which validates that AG-Meta outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.}

abstract = {Node classification is a popular and challenging task in graph neural networks, and existing approaches are mainly developed for a single network. With the advances in domain adaptation, researchers tend to leverage knowledge extracted from a fully-labeled source network to further improve the node classification performance in an unlabeled target network. This learning paradigm refers to cross-network node classification, which is the topic we studied in this paper. Specifically, we propose a novel model named Transferable Graph Auto-Encoders (TGAE), which first encodes the initial network data into latent representations and then decodes the learned features to preserve graph information. In the encoding phase, TGAE adopts the attentional mechanism to fuse the local and global information of nodes to discover latent node representations. To obtain transferable features between the source and target networks, TGAE aligns their distributions based on the learned representations by reducing marginal and conditional distribution differences. In the decoding phase, the latent representations are subjected to pairwise and reconstruction constraints, thus preserving structural proximity and graph topology information to learn discriminative features. Besides, a node classifier is trained to enhance the discriminant of the node representations further. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-network node classification tasks compared with existing methods.}

Split-based methods typically start with a mixture composed of a single component representing all data, and successively split and optimize components for a given model selection criterion. These algorithms are typically faster than alternatives, but depend critically on the component splitting method, since a good split rule promotes a faster convergence of the mixture optimization phase. We propose a new efficient and robust split rule that projects mixture components onto a 1D subspace and fits a two-component model to the projected data with the Expectation Maximization algorithm. The proposed approach is fast and robust to parameter tuning, being the ideal choice for applications that favor speed while still maintaining an acceptable accuracy. We illustrate the validity of the method through a series of experiments on synthetic and real datasets comparing the proposed method to alternatives of the state-of-the-art in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and sensitivity to parameter tuning.}

We propose a framework that addresses the problem of underfitting in the ensembling method using pre-trained models and improves the performance and robustness of deep learning models through ensemble diversity. For the naive weight ensembling framework, we discovered that the ensembled models could not lie in the same loss basin under extreme domain shift conditions, suggesting that a loss barrier may exist. We used a fine-tuning step after the weighted ensemble to address the underfitting problem caused by the loss barrier and stabilize the batch normalization running parameters. We also inferred through qualitative analysis that the diversity of ensemble models affects domain generalization. We validate our method on a large-scale image dataset (ImageNet-1K) and chemical molecule data, which is suitable for testing with domain shift problems due to its data-splitting method.}

Previous studies focused on identifying the reaction center using semi-templated retrosynthesis methods, which are limited to single reaction center identification. In reality, however, many reaction centers involve multiple bonds or atoms, referred to as multiple reaction centers. This paper introduces RCsearcher, a unified framework that exploits the strengths of graph neural networks and deep reinforcement learning for identifying both single and multiple reaction centers. The key insight of the framework is that the single or multiple reaction center must be a node-induced subgraph of the molecular product graph. At each step, RCsearcher selects a node in the molecular product graph and adds it to the explored node-induced subgraph as an action. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RCsearcher consistently outperforms other baselines, and is able to identify reaction center patterns not present in the training set. Ablation experiments confirm the effectiveness of individual components of RCsearcher, including the beam search and the one-hop constraint of the action space.}

In the shallow layer, we design Dynamic Positioning Attention (DPA). It will localize to the key feature information and construct a variable window for it, then perform attention calculation. DPA improves the learning ability of local details, reduces the amount of computation. At the deep level, Bi-Level Routing Attention (BRA) is used to discard irrelevant key‚Äìvalue pairs, achieve content-aware sparse attention for the deep dispersed semantic information, and improve computational efficiency.

It has attracted increasing attention during the past decade, however, there is a lack of methods capable of handling the imbalanced problem in a semi-supervised setting. This study proposes a label propagation technique to settle the semi-supervised imbalanced multi-label issue. Specially, we first utilize a collaborative manner to exploit the correlations from labels and instances, and learn a label regularization matrix to overcome the imbalanced problem in the labeled instance. After that, we extend to semi-supervised learning and explore to represent the similarity of instances with weighted graphs on labeled and unlabeled data. Then, the data distribution information and label correlations are fully utilized to design the loss function under the consistency assumption manner. At last, we present an iterative scheme to settle the optimization issue, thereby achieving label propagation to address the imbalanced challenge. Experiments on a variety of multi-label data sets show the favorable performance of the proposed method against related comparing approaches. Notably, the proposed method is also validated to be robust with a limited number of training instances.}

However, practical usage in various applications requires large-scale datasets, and real-world data contains various corruptions that degrade the model‚Äôs performance owing to the inconsistencies in the training and testing distributions. In this study, we propose Frequency re-Scaling Data Augmentation (FSDA) to improve the classification performance, robustness against corruption, and localizability of classifiers trained on various image classification datasets. Our method consists of two processes: mask generation process (MGP) and pattern re-scaling process (PSP). MGP clusters the frequency domain spectra to produce similar frequency patterns, and then PSP scales frequency by learning rescaling parameters from frequency patterns. Because the CNN classifies images by focusing on their structural features highlighted with FSDA, CNN trained with the proposed method has more robustness against corruption than that with the other data augmentations (DAs). Our technique outperforms the existing DAs on four public image classification datasets, including the CIFAR-10/100, STL-10, and ImageNet. Particularly, our strategy increases the robustness of the classifier against the different corruption errors by an average of 5.04% over the baseline.}

The collective integration of multisource datasets presents a potential remedy for this challenge. However, it is crucial to underscore that the mere addition of supplementary data does not automatically guarantee performance enhancement, given the unresolved challenges associated with multisource data. In this research, we address one such challenge, namely, the issue of incomplete labels arising from the diversity of annotations within multi-source ECG datasets. First, we identified three distinct types of label missing: dataset-related label missing, supertype missing, and subtype missing. To address the supertype missing effectively, we introduce a novel approach known as offline category mapping which leverages the hierarchical relationships inherent within the categories to recover the missing supertype labels. Additionally, two complementary strategies, referred to as prediction masking and online category mapping, are proposed to mitigating the adverse effects of subtype and dataset-related label missing on model optimization. These strategies enhance the model's ability to identify missing subtypes under conditions of weak supervision. These pioneering methodologies are integrated into a deep learning-based framework designed for multilabel ECG classification. The performance of our proposed framework is rigorously evaluated using realistic multi-source datasets obtained from the PhysioNet/CinC challenge 2020/2021. The proposed learning framework exhibits a notable improvement in macro-average precision, surpassing the corresponding baseline model by more than 25 % on the test datasets. As a result, this research study makes a substantial contribution to the field of ECG classification by addressing the critical issue of incomplete labels in multisource datasets, ultimately enhancing the generalization capabilities of machine learning models in this domain.}

While prior works typically focus on exploiting global features of the two modalities, herein we argue that more discriminative features can be derived by modeling ‚Äúwhere to fuse‚Äù. To investigate this, we propose a novel Locality-Aware Point-View Fusion Transformer (LATFormer) for 3D shape retrieval and classification. The core component of LATFormer is a module named Locality-Aware Fusion (LAF) which integrates the local features of correlated regions across the two modalities based on the co-occurrence scores. We further propose to filter out scores with low values to obtain salient local co-occurring regions, which reduces redundancy for the fusion process. In our LATFormer, we utilize the LAF module to fuse the multi-scale features of the two modalities both bidirectionally and hierarchically to obtain more informative features. Comprehensive experiments on four popular 3D shape benchmarks covering 3D object retrieval and classification validate its effectiveness.}

However, directly applying the existing contrastive learning framework for 3D skeleton learning is limited by the well-designed augmentations and the simple multi-stream decision-level fusion. To deal with these drawbacks, we propose a three-stream contrastive learning framework utilizing abundant information mining for self-supervised action representation (3s-AimCLR++). For single-stream contrastive learning, extreme augmentation is first proposed to generate more movement patterns, which can introduce more movement patterns to improve the universality of the learned representations. Since directly using extreme augmentation can barely boost the performance due to the drastic changes in original identity, the Distributional Divergence Minimization (DDM) loss is proposed to utilize the extreme augmentation more gently. Moreover, the Single-Stream Nearest Neighbors Mining (SNNM) is proposed to expand positive samples to make the learning process more reasonable. For multi-stream, existing methods simply ensemble the results. Yet, considering the complementarity of information between different streams, we propose Multi-Stream Aggregation and Interaction (MSAI) strategy to better fuse multi-stream information. Extensive experiments on NTU-60, NTU-120, and PKU-MMD datasets have verified that our 3s-AimCLR++ can significantly perform favorably against state-of-the-art methods under a variety of evaluation protocols.

First, AWDR constructs an anchor graph that encodes the classification information and establishes accurate connectivity components between anchors and clusters, thereby fully utilizing the discriminative information of the original samples. In addition, AWDR learns a complete-dictionary in the subspace to eliminate the noise and out-of-sample effects of the original sample space, while also improving computational efficiency. Finally, AWDR computes the coefficients for the samples in an adaptively weighted manner to find discriminative representation of the samples from the dictionary.

abstract = {The task of action-driven human motion prediction aims to forecast future human motion based on the observed sequence while respecting the given action label. It requires modeling not only the stochasticity within human motion but the smooth yet realistic transition between multiple action labels. However, the fact that most datasets do not contain such transition data complicates this task. Existing work tackles this issue by learning a smoothness prior to simply promote smooth transitions, yet doing so can result in unnatural transitions especially when the history and predicted motions differ significantly in orientations. In this paper, we argue that valid human motion transitions should incorporate realistic leg movements to handle orientation changes, and cast it as an action-conditioned in-betweening (ACB) learning task to encourage transition naturalness. Because modeling all possible transitions is virtually unreasonable, our ACB is only performed on very few selected action classes with active gait motions, such as ‚ÄúWalk‚Äù or ‚ÄúRun‚Äù. Specifically, we follow a two-stage forecasting strategy by first employing the motion diffusion model to generate the target motion with a specified future action, and then producing the in-betweening to smoothly connect the observation and prediction to eventually address motion prediction. Our method is completely free from the labeled motion transition data during training. To show the robustness of our approach, we generalize our trained in-betweening learning model on one dataset to two unseen large-scale motion datasets to produce natural transitions. Extensive experimental evaluations on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method yields the state-of-the-art performance in terms of visual quality, prediction accuracy, and action faithfulness.}

Transformers have been introduced to the Re-ID task due to their excellent ability to model long-range dependency. However, due to the properties of the global attention mechanism, they are less effective in capturing the discriminative local semantics of pedestrians compared to convolutional operations. To address this issue, we present a Multi-granularity Cross Transformer Network (MCTN) that progressively learns salient features of different local structures in a global context. Specifically, we first utilize a Multi-granularity Convolutional Layer (MCL) to investigate salient pedestrian features at various granularities. On this basis, we propose a Pyramidal Cross Transformer learning layer (PCT), which contains a pyramidal division of pedestrian image feature maps, differentiated feature extraction of different parts of pedestrians, and cross attention to exploring the local‚Äìglobal relationship of the feature map. It allows effective mining of local information in the global structure from a coarse-to-fine perspective. Furthermore, to enhance the interaction between low-level detailed features and high-level semantic features, a Hierarchical Aggregation Strategy (HAS) is introduced to fuse features learned by cross attention learning at different stages. Pedestrian features learned in shallow layers will serve as global priors for semantics learning in deep layers. We evaluate our method on four large-scale Re-ID datasets, and the experimental results reveal that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.}

Current methods rely on nearest-neighbour (NN) matching, where the query feature space is converted to NN space by representing each query pixel with its NN in the template. NN-based methods have been shown to perform better in occlusions, appearance changes, and non-rigid transformations; however, they scale poorly with high-resolution data and high feature dimensions. We present an NN-based method that efficiently reduces the NN computations and introduces filtering in the NN fields (NNFs). A vector quantization step is introduced before the NN calculation to represent the template with k features, and the filter response over the NNFs is used to compare the template and query distributions over the features. We show that state-of-the-art performance is achieved in low-resolution data, and our method outperforms previous methods at higher resolution.}

The central motivation is to be able to recognize a novel sign, even if it belongs to a sign language unseen during training, based on a small set of examples. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel embedding-based framework that first extracts a spatio-temporal visual representation based on video and hand features, as well as hand landmark estimates. To establish a comprehensive test bed, we propose three meta-learning FSSLR benchmarks that span multiple languages, and extensively evaluate the proposed framework. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach for few-shot sign language recognition in both monolingual and cross-lingual settings.}

The main challenge arises from that images and texts exist in heterogeneous spaces, leading to the difficulty to preserve the semantic consistency between both modalities. To narrow the modality gap, most recent methods resort to extra object detectors or parsers to obtain the hierarchical representations. In this work, we address this problem by introducing our Multi-Task Hierarchical Convolutional Neural Network (MT-HCN). It is characterized by mining the hierarchical semantic information without the aid of any extra supervisions. Firstly, from the perspective of representing architecture, we leverage the intrinsic hierarchical structure of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to decompose the representations of both modalities into two semantically complementary levels, i.e., exterior representations and concept representations. The former focuses on discovering the fine-grained low-level associations between both modalities, meanwhile the latter underlines capturing more high-level abstract semantics. Specifically, we present a Self-Supervised Clustering (SSC) loss to preserve more fine-grained semantic clues in exterior representations. It is constituted on the basis of viewing multiple image/text pairs with similar exterior as a category. In addition, a novel harmonious bidirectional triplet ranking (HBTR) loss is proposed, which mitigate the adverse effects brought about by the biased and noisy negative samples. Besides hardest negatives, it also imposes the constraints on the distance between the positive pairs and the centroid of negative pairs. Extensive experimental results on two popular cross-modal retrieval benchmarks demonstrate our proposed MT-HCN can achieve the competitive results compared with the state-of-the-art methods.}

Currently, researchers have paid greater attention to graph-based MvC methods. However, most existing methods only consider the original graph structure and pay relatively little attention to the graph structure in the latent space. In addition, most methods need to pay more attention to the consistency of information on different labels. Otherwise, this may lead to the loss of label information. This paper presents a new multi-view clustering framework to address the above issues. The proposed method considers both the information in the latent space and the original data space, which firstly obtains the pseudo-label by latent representation learning and then lets the pseudo-label guide the learning of the complementary information between the raw data views. To ensure the integrity of the data structure, a latent graph structure recovery strategy is designed in the latent space. Finally, an enhanced label fusion strategy is designed to fusion the different types of labels, yielding an information-rich label matrix for clustering. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method‚Äôs effectiveness compared to other advanced approaches.}

However, low resolution of ultrasound image and high similarity between different category images pose great challenges to this task, which requires the network to be more capable of extracting image features. Therefore, in response to the efficient classification of BI-RADS 4a-4c in breast ultrasound images, we developed a lightweight classification network IDCNet, a neural network model combining the advantages of convolutional neural network(CNN) and CapsNet. In this model: Firstly, we proposed ID-Net based on CNN architecture and mainly constructed by ID block and DD block, which ensure the ID-Net deep and wide enough to extract sufficient local semantic information of image, and at the same time being lightweight. Secondly, we use the CapsNet to learn the position and posture information between the global features of the image, which makes up for the defects of CNN. Finally, two parallel paths of IDCNet and CapsNet are fused to enhance IDCNet's capability of feature extraction. To verify our method, experiments have been conducted on the breast ultrasound dataset of Yunnan cancer hospital and two public datasets. The classification results of our method have been compared with those obtained by five existing approaches. The experimental results show that the proposed method IDCNet has the highest Accuracy (98.54 %), Precision (98.54 %) and F1 score (98.54 %).}

However, one main shortcoming of these algorithms is that they essentially fit a mixture of identical spherical Gaussians to data that vastly deviates from such a distribution. In comparison, general Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) can fit richer structures but require estimating a quadratic number of parameters per cluster to represent the covariance matrices. This poses two main issues: (i) the underlying optimization problems are challenging due to their larger number of local minima, and (ii) their solutions can overfit the data. In this work, we design search strategies that circumvent both issues. We develop more effective optimization algorithms for general GMMs, and we combine these algorithms with regularization strategies that avoid overfitting. Through extensive computational analyses, we observe that optimization or regularization in isolation does not substantially improve cluster recovery. However, combining these techniques permits a completely new level of performance previously unachieved by k-means algorithm variants, unraveling vastly different cluster structures. These results shed new light on the current status quo between GMM and k-means methods and suggest the more frequent use of general GMMs for data exploration. To facilitate such applications, we provide open-source code as well as Julia packages (UnsupervisedClustering.jl and RegularizedCovarianceMatrices.jl) implementing the proposed techniques.}

There is little research on automatic renal segmentation with renal dynamic imaging. To address this issue, an improved model based on a deep neural network called Renal Automatic Segmentation Network (RASNet) is proposed, to aid in the automatic segmentation of renal contours. Besides, a multi-scale spatial perception module and a decoding module with attention connection are introduced to enrich the semantic information and further improve the accuracy of network segmentation. Extensive experiments were conducted on a renal dynamic medical image database established in this paper. Analysis results show the superiority of the proposed RASNet to several existing segmentation frameworks.}

Recent studies on MUDA have focused on aligning the distribution of each pair of source and target domains in separate feature spaces to reduce their domain shift. However, these approaches suffer from two main shortcomings. First, they usually focus on the global domain shift which lacks consideration of the joint distribution of category-corresponded subdomains. Second, out-of-distribution samples far from the sample center are hard to align by the global domain alignment. Therefore, we propose a novel Deep Joint Semantic Adaptive Network (DJSAN) for MUDA. Specifically, a new maximum mean discrepancy-based metric, Joint Semantic Maximum Mean Discrepancy (JSMMD), is proposed, which can uniformly optimize the cross-domain joint distribution of category-corresponded subdomains on multiple task-specific layers. Moreover, to deal with the out-of-distribution hard samples, we propose an across-domain data augmentation method called Source-Target Domain Mixing (STDMix) to enhance the robustness of the model, which synthesizes the source domain and target domain into a new domain at a fixed ratio and utilizes information entropy to provide reliable pseudo-labels for samples in the target domain. Experimental results on three public datasets, i.e., Office-31, Digits-five, and Office-Home, show that our proposed method achieves improvements of 0.3%, 1.8%, and 2.7% in average accuracy, respectively.}

The impact is studied in a large experimental comparison on a variety of benchmark datasets. The results reveal that the main factor determining the performance is the type of anomalies in the dataset. While deep methods embedding the whole set to a single fixed vector perform well on point cloud data, the methods embedding each feature vector independently are better for datasets from multi-instance learning. Moreover, sophisticated methods utilizing transformer blocks are frequently inferior to simple models with properly optimized hyperparameters. An independent factor in performance is the cardinality of sets, the proper treatment of which remains an open problem, as the existing analytical solution was found to be inaccurate.}

Most common form of image degradation occurs in the form of noise. The amount of degradation in noisy images is measured by estimating the noise level. Many image processing applications such as denoising, restoration, segmentation, compression etc. use noise level information as a prior; inaccurate estimate of which may impact their performance. In this article, we explore natural image statistics in locality preserving transform domain. This property groups structurally similar images/image patches when projected in the transform domain. Image patches corrupted with similar noise level get projected close by in the locality preserving domain and show consistent coefficient behaviour. In particular, we use Two Dimensional Orthogonal Locality Preserving Projection (2DOLPP) as the domain transformation technique. 2DOLPP basis, representing natural images, are learnt in advance from a set of clean images, thereby reducing the computational time significantly. Features based on natural image statistics are extracted from 2DOLPP domain representation of input image patches. Mapping from feature space to noise level is carried out using support vector regression. The proposed noise estimation approach is at par with or surpasses the state-of-the-art techniques with much less computational time. Performance of this approach is stable across a wide range of noise levels and independent of the image structure.}

In this paper, we propose to decouple the multi-view representation learning into the shared and specific information extractions with parallel branches, and seamlessly adopt feature fusion in end-to-end models. The common feature is obtained based on the view-agnostic contrastive learning and view-discriminative training to minimize the discrepancy within the views. Simultaneously, the specific feature is learned with orthogonality constraints to minimize the view-level correlation. Besides, the semantic information in the features is reserved with supervised training. After disentangling the representations, we fuse the mutually complementary common and specific features for downstream tasks. Particularly, we provide a theoretical explanation for our method from an information bottleneck perspective. Compared with state-of-the-art multi-view models on benchmark datasets, we empirically demonstrate the advantage of our method in several downstream tasks, such as ordinary classification and few-shot learning. In addition, extensive experiments validate the robustness and transferability of our approach, when applying the learned representation on the source dataset to several target datasets.}

Due to the sequential and discrete nature, the discrete sequence clustering problem is more challenging and most of existing vector data clustering algorithms cannot be directly employed. In this paper, we present a stochastic algorithm for clustering discrete sequences. Our method first quickly generates a set of random partitions over the sequential data set and then merges these random clustering results via weighted graph construction and partition.

Distance metric learning-based methods have emerged as a prominent approach to FSC, which typically use a distance function to measure the difference between query and support samples for identifying the class membership of the query sample. However, these methods simply treat each channel difference between query and support features equally when computing the class scores. Since different channels in the learned feature seek for different patterns, these distance metrics fail to consider that different channels are of different importance to FSC, and thus cannot accurately measure the similarity between samples. To address this issue, we propose a Query-Centric Distance Modulator (QCDM) to generate query-related weights for each channel difference adaptively. Specifically, since the distribution of difference between a query sample and all support samples in a particular channel can reflect the importance of this channel to the classification of the query sample, we take this difference vector as input and generate a query-specific channel weight through a meta-network. QCDM can guide FSC models to focus on discriminative channel differences and achieve better generalization. QCDM is a plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated with existing distance metric learning-based FSC methods. Extensive experimental results indicate that our method can effectively improve the performance of distance metric learning-based FSC methods.

abstract = {Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) has drawn widespread attention in data mining on graphs due to its outstanding performance and rigor theoretical guarantee. However, some recent studies have revealed that GCN-based methods may mine latent information insufficiently owing to the underutilization of the feature space. Besides, the unlearnable topology also significantly imperils the performance of GCN-based methods. In this paper, we conduct experiments to investigate these issues, finding that GCN does not fully consider the potential structure in the feature space, and a fixed topology deteriorates the robustness of GCN. Thus, it is desired to distill node features and establish a learnable graph. Motivated by this goal, we propose a framework dubbed Graph Convolutional Network with elastic topology (GCNet11The source code is available at https://github.com/ZhihaoWu99/GCNet.). With the analysis of the optimization for the proposed flexible Laplacian embedding, GCNet is naturally constructed by alternative graph convolutional layers and adaptive topology learning layers. GCNet aims to deeply explore the feature space and employ the mined information to construct a learnable topology, which leads to a more robust graph representation. In addition, a set-level orthogonal loss is utilized to meet the orthogonal constraint required by the flexible Laplacian embedding and promote better class separability. Moreover, comprehensive experiments indicate that GCNet achieves remarkable performance and generalization on several real-world datasets.}

abstract = {Deep learning techniques have been widely used for two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) computer vision problems, such as object detection, super-resolution (SR) and classification to name a few. Radar images suffer from poor resolution as compared to optical images, hence developing a high-accuracy model to solve computer vision problems, such as a classifier, is a challenge. This is because of the lack of high-frequency details in the input images which makes it difficult for the classifier model to generate accurate predictions. Ways of addressing this challenge include training the learning model with a large dataset or using a more complicated model, such as deeper layer architecture. However, employing such approaches might result in the overfitting of the model, where the model might not generalize well on previously unseen data. Also, generating a large dataset for training the model is a challenging task, especially in the case of radar images. An alternate solution for achieving high accuracy in radar classification problems is provided in this paper wherein a CNN-enabled super-resolution (SR) model is integrated with the classifier model. The SR model is trained to generate high-resolution (HR) millimeter-wave (mmW) images from any input low-resolution (LR) mmW images. These resolved images from the SR model will be used by the classifier model to classify the input images into appropriate classes, consisting of threat and non-threat objects. The training data for the dual CNN layers are generated using a numerical model of a near-field coded-aperture computational imaging (CI) system. This trained dual CNN model is tested with simulated data generated from the CI numerical model wherein a high classification accuracy of 95% and a fast inference time of 0.193 s are obtained, making it suitable for real-time automated threat classification applications. For fair comparison, the developed CNN model is also validated with experimentally generated reconstruction data, in which case, a classification accuracy of 94% is obtained.}

abstract = {Cross-modal hashing has received growing interest to facilitating efficient retrieval across large-scale multi-modal data, and existing methods still face three challenges: 1) Most offline learning works are unsuitable for processing and training with streaming multi-modal data. 2) Current online learning methods rarely consider the potential interdependency between the label categories. 3) Existing supervised methods often utilize pairwise label similarities or adopt relaxation scheme to learn hash codes, which, respectively, require much computation time or accumulate large quantization loss during the learning process. To alleviate these challenges, this paper presents an efficient Online Label Consistent Hashing (OLCH) approach for streaming cross-modal retrieval. The proposed approach first exploits the relative similarity of semantic labels and utilizes the multi-class classification to derive the common semantic vector. Then, an online semantic representation learning framework is adaptively designed to preserve the semantic similarity across different modalities, and a mini-batch online gradient descent approach associated with forward‚Äìbackward splitting is developed to discriminatively optimize the hash functions. Accordingly, the hash codes are incrementally learned with high discriminative capability, while avoiding high computation complexity to process the streaming data. Extensive experiments highlight the superiority of the proposed approach and show its very competitive performance in comparison with the state-of-the-arts.}

First, we propose the Residual Clique Block (RCB) to fully exploit compact feature representations for image Super-Resolution (SR). Second, a series of RCBs are cascaded in a coarse-to-fine manner to construct the Pyramid Residual Clique Network (PRCN), which simultaneously reconstructs multiple SR results (e.g. 2√ó, 4√ó, and 8√ó) in one feed-forward pass. Third, we utilize the human parsing map as the shape prior, and the high-frequency sub-bands of Uniform Discrete Curvelet Transform (UDCT) as the texture prior to enhance the details of reconstructed human body image. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior visual quality and PSNR/SSIM scores.

The automatic segmentation of retinal vessel (RV) has become one of the key issues in the quantification of retinal indicators. To this end, there are various methods proposed with cutting-edge designs and techniques in the literature. However, most of them only learn features from single-modal data, despite the potential relation between data from different modalities. Clinically, 2D projection maps are more convenient for doctors to observe. Nevertheless, 3D volumes preserve the intrinsic retinal structure. We thus propose a novel multi-modal feature mutual learning framework that contains local mutual learning and global mutual learning capturing 2D and 3D information. In the framework, the 3D model and 2D model learn collaboratively and teach each other throughout the training process. Experimental results show that our method outperforms previous deep-learning methods in RV segmentation. The generalization experiments on the ROSE dataset demonstrate the portability and scalability of the proposed framework.}

abstract = {In self-driving cars, adverse weather (e.g., fog, rain, snow, and cloud) or occlusion scenarios result in domain shift being unavoidable in object detection. Researchers have recently proposed Domain Adaptive Object Detection (DAOD), i.e., aligning the source and target domains at the image and instance levels distribution by utilizing the Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) method. However, the semantic correlation information is ignored leading to the effect of aligning not good, and low detection accuracy of objects in adverse weather or occlusion scenarios. Here, we propose a Dual Semantic Correlation Alignment (DSCA) method for DAOD to address the problem. The core idea behind DSCA is to make full use of semantic correlation information including context correlation semantic information and class correlation semantic information to align object semantic information in source and target domains, which supplement and enhance the missing information for target domains. It consists of a two-level semantic alignment: (1) context correlation semantic alignment is developed to obtain the context correlation semantic information of the object to align context semantic information at the image level; (2) class correlation semantic alignment is proposed to obtain the class correlation semantic information of the object to align class semantic information at the instance level. The two-level semantic alignment can effectively decrease negative transfer and complete object information to improve the detection accuracy of objects in different domains. Experiments on four challenging benchmarks show that our proposed DSCA method outperforms state-of-the-art DAOD methods.}

In this work, we propose a new unsupervised algorithm for HAR from mocap data to leverage both spatial and temporal information embedded in activity sequences. For this, we employ a shallow graph neural network (GNN) comprising a graph convolutional network and a gated recurrent unit to aggregate the spatial and temporal features of the mocap sequences, respectively. Moreover, we encode the transformations of the human body through log-regularized kernel covariance descriptors linked to the trajectory movement maps of mocap frames. These descriptors are then fused with the GNN features for downstream activity recognition tasks. Finally, HAR is performed by a new unsupervised algorithm using a neighborhood Laplacian regularizer and a normalized dictionary learning approach. The generalizability of the proposed model is validated by training the GNN on a public dataset and testing on the other datasets. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated using six publicly available human mocap datasets. Compared to existing approaches, the proposed model improves activity recognition consistently by 12%‚Äì30% across different datasets.}

In response to the issue that LDA lacks robustness to non-Gaussian data with rich local information, improvements on LDA explore the subspace manifold structure by building a fully connected similarity graph. However, these methods are vulnerable to the interference of noisy and redundant information. In this paper, we propose a new local LDA method, named adaptive and fuzzy locality discriminant analysis (AFLDA), which aims at extracting precise and compact features. Firstly, an adaptive and fuzzy k-means strategy is adopted, where the membership between data and corresponding subclass centers for each class is learned to establish a hybrid bipartite graph and capture local information. Secondly, we design a discrete and probability constraint imposed on the membership matrix to explore the intricate structure of multimodal data. Moreover, the subblock partition for each class makes data accommodate to multimodal subclasses. Thirdly, the maximum total scatter regularization term is introduced, which amply disperses the data to enhance the recognition of local structure and avoid trivial solutions. Finally, to eliminate the interference of noisy and redundant information, AFLDA learns an optimized subspace, where cluster centers and the membership matrix are updated alternately. Promising results in experiments illustrate the efficacy of the model.}

Advantageously using the correlation among different labels can provide better performance than methods that manage each label separately. In recent decades, many methods have been developed to deal with multilabel datasets, which makes it difficult to decide which method is the most appropriate for a given task. In this paper, we present the most comprehensive comparison carried out so far. We compare a total of 62 different methods and several configurations of each one for a total of 197 trained models. We also use a large set of problems comprising 65 datasets. In addition, we studied the efficiency of the methods considering six different classification performance metrics.

Our model leverages visual, semantic, and positional features, with the positional features being adaptively generated through a layout-aware position embedding module. Then, different modality features are enhanced via a two-staged position-guided multi-modal fusion module.

However, distribution variations among cameras inevitably introduce noise in the generated pseudo-labels. Moreover, they are often assigned offline using relatively simple clustering criteria, which further accumulates the noise and limits the potential improvement in model performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel camera-aware cluster-instance joint online learning (CCIOL) framework that leverages the online inter-camera K-reciprocal nearest neighbors (OICKRNs) mined for each sample at every iteration to soften the traditional hard pseudo-labels at the cluster-level and generate multi-labels at the instance-level. Additionally, contrastive learning losses at two levels are employed to rectify the erroneous closeness between samples and promote intra-class aggregation and inter-class separation.

Base on this knowledge, we propose a novel multi-label feature selection method named LRDG that explores latent representation learning and dynamic graph constraints. Specifically, we introduce the latent representation of instance relevance as supervisory information for pseudo-label learning, and minimize information loss during pseudo-label learning by means of the label manifold, the non-negative constraints, and the minimization of the Frobenius norm between pseudo-labels and ground-truth labels. In addition, considering the shortcomings brought by traditional graph regularization, we propose to use the dynamic graph constructed from low-dimensional pseudo-labels to constrain feature weights.

In this paper, we put forward a robust multi-view joint sparse representation (RMJSR) method for multi-view learning. Firstly, we design a novel multi-view Cauchy estimator based loss function originating from robust statistics to address complex noises and outliers in reality. Based on this, we leverage the ‚Ñì1,q norm to enhance our model by encouraging the learned representation of multiple views to share the same sparsity pattern. Secondly, to explore the optimal solution for the RMJSR model, we devise an effective optimization algorithm based on the half-quadratic (HQ) theory and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework. Thirdly, we provide the theoretical guarantee for revealing the theoretical condition for the success of the proposed method. Further, we have also provided extensive analysis of the proposed method, including the optimality condition, convergence analysis, and complexity analysis. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method in comparison with state-of-the-art competitors.

abstract = {Scribble annotations have recently become popular in video salient object detection. Previous methods only focus on utilizing shallow feature consistency for more integral predictions. However, there is potential for consistency between cross-frame deep features to be used to help regularize saliency predictions better. Besides, we have observed that leveraging saliency predictions as pseudo-supervision signals yields notable improvements in extracting both intra-frame and cross-frame deep features. This, in turn, leads to more precise and detailed object structural information. Thus, we propose a cross-frame feature-saliency mutual reinforcing training process to assist scribble annotations for integral video saliency predictions. Specifically, we design a cross-frame feature regularization head, which leverages intra-frame and cross-frame deep feature consistency to regularize saliency predictions as auxiliary supervision. Then, to help obtain more accurate feature consistency, we design a cross-frame saliency regularization head, where predicted saliency values are used as pseudo-supervision signals to acquire better feature consistency. In this way, our cross-frame feature and saliency regularization heads can benefit from each other to help the network learn more accurately. Extensive experiments show that our method can achieve better performances than the previous best methods. The project is available at https://github.com/muchengxue0911/CFMR.}

It is empirically observed that instances with different labels may display considerable similarity in visual characteristics, making it challenging to distinguish between them in the feature space. To this end, we propose a dual-branch Relation Fusion Propagation Network (RFPN) for transductive few-shot learning, which explicitly models both feature and label relations across support-query pairs. Specifically, we design a Relation Fusion Block (RFB) to fuse instance-level and class-level relations, thus obtaining more robust fusion-level relations to guide feature propagation. In addition to the feature propagation branch, we encode the label relations and construct a label shortcut branch for label propagation. To alleviate the error accumulation during propagation, which is caused by uncertain pseudo-labels for query samples, we propose a Label Shortcut Mechanism (LSM) to progressively update the sample relations with the initial labels. Our full method is plug-and-play and can be easily applied in existing graph-based approaches for transductive few-shot learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed RFPN yields significant improvements over the baselines and achieves promising performance on four popular few-shot classification benchmarks.}

However, fusion between the two modalities faces huge challenge due to the difference of their optical dimensions. Existed fusion methods can't keep a balance between performance and efficiency in aggregating detailed features. To address this problem, we propose a global feature-based network (GFBN) for semantic segmentation that establishes mapping function and extraction relationship among the multi-modalities. The GFBN contains three important modules, which are used for feature correction, fusion and edge enhancement. Firstly, the cross-attention rectification module (CARM) adaptively extracts mapping relationships and rectifies the RGB and complementary features. Secondly, the cross-field fusion module (CFM) integrates long-range rectified features of two branches to obtain an optimal fusion feature. Finally, the boundary guidance module (BGM) sharpens the boundary information of the fused features to effectively improve the segmentation accuracy of object boundaries. We make the experiments of GFBN on the challenging MCubeS and ZJU-RGB-Ps datasets. The results show that GFBN outperforms state-of-the-art methods by at least 0.64 % and 0.7 % on mean intersection over union (mIoU), respectively.

Although existing methods have promising leaning abilities, they ignore the intrinsic local structure contained in base kernels, which may negatively affect their performances. To address the above problem, a novel method, termed as consensus graph learning based on local kernels (CGLLK), is introduced. CGLLK is based on the partitions extracted by kernel k-means. Specifically, we first design a simple yet effective scheme to construct the local kernels of base kernels and then a consensus graph is applied to capture the complementary information contained in the extracted partitions of local kernels. CGLLK also considers the prior knowledge existing in base kernels. Since the partitions of local kernels and the learning stage of the consensus graph contain useful information for each other, the two processes are optimized jointly. Extensive experiments on some popular datasets are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experimental results illustrate that CGLLK is much more competitive than the state-of-the-art algorithms.}

abstract = {Multilayer perceptron (MLP) fails to discriminate the ambiguous inputs belonging to the overlapping regions of multiple classes, resulting in misclassification. To classify the input samples accurately according to their classes, removing the ambiguity that occurred due to the sharing of common input space is important. In this article, a novel neural network framework, called Discriminative Regularized Input Manifold MLP (DRIM-MLP) is proposed to reduce this ambiguity and improve the classification accuracy. The proposed framework consists of two different feed forward networks that are trained simultaneously: (i) DRIM and (ii) MLP. The proposed DRIM learns the input distribution during its training and the learnt information is incorporated during the training of MLP to reduce the ambiguity. Simultaneously, the class information learnt by MLP is incorporated into the DRIM to learn discriminative information of the input distribution. The hidden layer output of DRIM estimates (i) the input of DRIM using the weights of hidden and output layers of DRIM and (ii) the class output of MLP using the weights of hidden and output layers of MLP. Here, the estimated class output, learnt by the DRIM that contains information of the input distribution, is used as a regularizer for the MLP to minimize the difference between the estimated class output of DRIM and the estimated class output of MLP itself. The hidden layer of MLP also estimates: (i) the class output of MLP using the weights between hidden and output layers of MLP and (ii) the input of DRIM using the weights between hidden and output layers of DRIM. Here, the estimated input learnt by MLP that contains class information is used as a regularizer for DRIM to minimize the difference between the estimated input of DRIM itself and the estimated input of MLP. These two regularizers are respectively called the Input manifold Regularizer (ImR) and the Discriminative Regularizer (DiscR). The experimental results based on ten standard data sets strongly support the effectiveness of the proposed DRIM-MLP compared to conventional MLP, auto encoder based MLP (AE-MLP), denoising auto encoder based MLP (DAE-MLP), AE-MLP with KLD, DAE-MLP with KLD along with two recent works of state-of-the-art.}

In recent years, iterative methods based on Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) have showcased remarkable achievements in this domain. Despite their high accuracy, these methods suffer from notable limitations such as a reliance on a large number of iterations and a tendency to lose high-frequency details. To address these issues, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware framework that combines 3D convolution and GRU-based iterations, aiming to improve efficiency and accuracy. Specifically, we first introduce a probabilistic method to jointly train the disparity map and its corresponding uncertainty map using 3D convolutions. Next, leveraging the uncertainty map as a guide, we develop a novel uncertainty reweighting iterative module to assist in identifying errors in the coarse disparity and cost volume, thereby refining the disparity estimation process and significantly improving the iteration efficiency. Moreover, we introduce a high-resolution refinement module that utilizes Pixel Difference Convolution (PDC) to incorporate additional gradient information. This module can fine-tune the disparity estimation to enhance accuracy. Finally, our network is evaluated on multiple widely-used benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate its proficiency in predicting precise boundaries and effectively reduce iterations. Our model achieves comparable performance to other state-of-the-art methods, ranking 1st on KITTI 2015, and 2nd on KITTI 2012. These results validate its strong performance and generalizability.}

abstract = {Light field (LF) imaging is an effective way to enable immersive applications. However, limited by the potential well capacity of the image sensor, the acquired LF images suffer from low dynamic range and are thus prone to under-exposure or over-exposure. High dynamic range (HDR) LF imaging is an efficacious avenue to improve the LF imaging's dynamic range. Unfortunately, for dynamic scenes, existing methods are inclined to produce ghosting artifacts and lose details in the saturated regions, while potentially damaging the parallax structure of generated HDR LF images. To address the above challenges, in this paper, we propose a new ghost-free HDR LF imaging method based on a deformable aggregation and angular embedding network. Specifically, considering the four-dimensional geometric structure of the LF image, a deformable alignment module is first designed to handle dynamic regions in the spatial domain, and then the aligned spatial features are fully fused through an aggregation operation. Subsequently, an angular embedding module is constructed to explore angular information to enhance the aggregated spatial features. Based on this, the above two modules are cascaded in a multi-scale manner to achieve multi-level feature extraction and enhance the feature representation ability. Finally, a decoder is leveraged to recover the ghost-free HDR LF image from the enhanced multi-scale features. For performance evaluation, this paper establishes a large-scale benchmark dataset with multi-exposure inputs and ground truth images. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method generates visually pleasing HDR LF images while preserving accurate angular consistency. Moreover, the proposed method surpasses the state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative comparisons. The code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/YeyaoChen/HDRLFI.}

This provides better supervision and leads to more precise predictions, retaining the capability of the model to yield outputs autoregressively for any future time horizon. We test our model on the challenging Cityscapes dataset, obtaining state of the art results for both flow and depth forecasting.

Most existing descriptors rely on hand-crafted models to achieve rotation stability, which are susceptible to complex noise and fail to efficiently extract batches of three-dimensional features, particularly for ultrasound volume. In this study, a translation equivariant design was performed based on the fully convolutional network to extract descriptors at different positions in batches by removing position bias errors, thereby improving the descriptor extraction efficiency. Descriptor rotation consistency is used for self-supervised training to avoid the need for data annotation. Before matching, the image ROI is restructured to adjust the input size of the network, further improving the descriptor extraction efficiency. Then, the multi-consistencies filter based on the correlation among descriptors, spatial positions, and texture features is designed to preserve stable matched pairs for accurate and robust registration results. Classification experimental results based on rotation stability show that the descriptors extracted by the proposed method have high classification accuracy, particularly under interference, such as noise, blur, and artifacts. Experimental results of clinical ultrasound image registration show that the proposed method has a lower registration error of 3.59 ¬± 1.15 mm compared with other methods. In addition, the descriptor extraction network proposed in this study has low training costs and high processing speed, further revealing the potential of the proposed method in clinical applications.}

The proposed network uses wavelet transformation and inverse wavelet transformation as an alternative to down-sampling and up-sampling operations, respectively, in order to add sparsity to the network. By training the model on both spatial and frequency domains, it learns non-stationary features that are found to be useful to remove haze and rain effects from images. The proposed model is tested on several rain and haze-affected image datasets, and it performs well in terms of standard evaluation metrics like structural similarity index measure and peak signal-to-noise ratio.

Second, we propose a method to identify insignificant adversarial examples at a minimal cost. Third, we demonstrate that our approach can be integrated with other adversarial training frameworks with few modifications. The experimental results show that combined with previous works, our approach not only reduces about 20% of computational cost on the CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets but also improves about 1.5% natural accuracy.

However, the current state-of-the-art still encounters scientific challenges when it comes to modeling human movements. There are two key aspects that need to be addressed. Firstly, new models should consider the stochastic nature of human movement and the physical structure of the human body to accurately predict the patterns in full-body motion descriptors over time. Secondly, while deep learning algorithms have been utilized, they lack explainability in terms of predicting body posture sequences, making it essential to improve their comprehensible representation of human movement. This paper aims to tackle these challenges by presenting three innovative methods for creating explainable representations of human movement. The study formulates human body movement as a state-space model based on the Gesture Operational Model (GOM). Model parameters are estimated through either one-shot training employing Kalman Filters or data-intensive training utilizing artificial neural networks.

However, existing descriptors are difficult to have both high descriptiveness and strong robustness to various nuisances (e.g., noise and occlusion). To address this problem, a descriptor named Fully Attribute-pairs Statistical Histogram (FApSH) is proposed. FApSH is constructed on a local reference axis (LRA), and fully encodes the relevancy information of five attributes at each neighbor point by ten attribute-pair statistics. In this process, a priori distribution-based partition strategy is proposed for evenly distributing the attribute values of all neighbor points, and a radial distance-based histogram assignment method is proposed to improve the robustness to noise and outliers. The proposed methods are rigorously evaluated on six benchmark datasets with different application scenarios and nuisances. The results show that FApSH has high descriptiveness and strong robustness. It obviously outperforms the existing handcrafted descriptors, and is comparable to some superior learning-based descriptors. The results also show that the proposed priori distribution-based partition strategy significantly reduces the length and also improves the descriptiveness of FApSH, and the proposed radial distance-based histogram assignment method improves the robustness of FApSH on various datasets.}

The aim of this work is to evaluate the two counterparts, as well as a new framework proposed here, named Neural Knitwork, which maps pixel coordinates to local texture patches rather than singular pixel values. The utility of the proposed technique is demonstrated on the tasks of image inpainting, super-resolution, and denoising. It is shown that the Neural Knitwork can outperform the standard coordinate-based MLP baseline for the tasks of inpainting and denoising, and perform comparably for the super-resolution task.}

abstract = {Fusion of high spatial resolution multispectral (HR MS) and low spatial resolution hyperspectral (LR HS) images has become a significant way to produce high spatial resolution hyperspectral (HR HS) images. Though many methods have exploited the spatial nonlocal similarity (SNS) and spectral band correlation (SBC) in the HR HS image, it is difficult to model the priors explicitly because the HR HS image is unavailable in real scenes. As the low-dimensional degradation versions, HR MS and LR HS images inherit the SNS and SBC in the HR HS image, respectively. But these methods seldom consider the inheritance of SNS and SBC between the two source images and the HR HS image. In this paper, we propose a spatial‚Äìspectral dual adaptive graph embedding model (SDAGE) to exploit the SNS and SBC in HR MS and LR HS images for the regularization of their fusion. Specifically, spatial and spectral graphs are constructed adaptively to describe the SNS in the HR MS image and the SBC in the LR HS image. Then, the two graphs are embedded into the features for the reconstruction of the HR HS image. In this way, it is explicit to ensure the consistency of SNS and SBC between the source images and the HR HS image. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our SDAGE method. The code can be downloaded from https://github.com/RSMagneto/SDAGE.}

abstract = {In crowdsourcing scenarios, we can obtain each instance‚Äôs multiple noisy label set from different workers and then use a ground truth inference algorithm to infer its integrated label. Despite the effectiveness of ground truth inference algorithms, there is still a certain level of noise in integrated labels. To reduce the impact of noise, many noise correction algorithms have been proposed in recent years. To the best of our knowledge, almost all these algorithms assume that workers have the same labeling certainty on different classes and instances. However, it is rarely true in reality due to the differences in workers‚Äô individual preferences and cognitive abilities. In this paper, we argue that the labeling certainty of a worker should be class-dependent and instance-dependent. Based on this premise, we propose a certainty weighted voting-based noise correction (CWVNC) algorithm. At first, we use the consistency between worker-labeled labels and integrated labels on different classes to estimate the class-dependent certainty. Then, we train a probability-based classifier on the instances labeled by each worker separately and use it to estimate the instance-dependent certainty. Finally, we correct the integrated label of each instance by weighted voting based on class-dependent certainty and instance-dependent certainty. When the proposed algorithm CWVNC is examined, the average noise ratio of CWVNC on 34 simulated datasets is equal to 15.08%, and on two real-world datasets ‚ÄúIncome‚Äù and ‚ÄúMusic_genre‚Äù the noise ratio is equal to 25.77% and 26.94%, respectively. The results show that CWVNC significantly outperforms all other state-of-the-art noise correction algorithms used for comparison.}

We integrate in-context examples and pre-answers into the prompt to inspire the LLM. In addition, we choose LLaMA instead of GPT-3, which is an open and free model.

Deep learning techniques have played a critical role in advancing decoding models for visual stimulus reconstruction from fMRI data. Particularly, the use of advanced GANs has resulted in significant improvements in the quality of image generation, providing a powerful tool for addressing the challenges of this complex task. However, none of these studies have taken into account the inherent characteristics of the stimulus contents themselves; This, in turn, leads to unsatisfactory outcomes, as demonstrated by the inconsistent identity between reconstructed faces and ground truth in the decoding of facial images. In order to tackle this challenge, we introduce a new framework aimed at enhancing the accuracy of reconstructing facial images from fMRI data. Our key innovation involves extracting and disentangling multi-level visual information from brain signals in the latent space and optimizing high-level features for facial identity control using identity loss. Specifically, our framework uses StyleGAN inversion to extract hierarchical latent codes from images, which are then bridged to fMRI data through transformation blocks. Additionally, we introduce a multi-stage refinement method to enhance the accuracy of reconstructed faces, which involves progressively updating fMRI latent codes with custom loss functions designed for both feature- and image-wise optimization. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework effectively achieves two critical objectives: (1) accurate facial image reconstruction from fMRI data and (2) preservation of identity characteristics with a high level of consistency.}

First, we cluster the seen data into multiple clusters, where the samples in each cluster belong to several original seen categories, so as to facilitate fine-grained semantic disentangling of visual feature vectors. Then, we introduce representation random swapping and contrastive learning based on the clustering results to realize the disentangling semantic representations of semantic-unspecific, class-shared, and class-unique. The fine-grained semantic disentangling representations show high intra-class similarity and inter-class discriminability, which improve the performance of GZSL by alleviating the problem of domain shift. Finally, we construct the visual-semantic embedding space by the variational auto-encoder and alignment module, which can bridge the semantic gap by generating strongly discriminative unseen class samples. Extensive experimental results on four public data sets prove that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generalized and conventional settings.}

abstract = {Ensemble clustering (EC) gains more and more attention because it can improve the effectiveness and robustness of single clustering methods. A popular ensemble approach is to construct a co-association matrix which represents the possibility that the sample pair is divided into different clusters by base clusterings. Then, some single clustering methods could be performed on it. However, this approach separates the construction of the co-association matrix from the generation of clustering results. Besides, the importance of base clusterings and clusters are often regarded as the same but their performance or quality is different actually. Although some weighted ensemble clustering methods have been proposed, typically, the weights are calculated based on certain criteria and then fixed. To cope with these issues, we propose a Parameter-Free Ensemble Clustering (PFEC) with dynamic weighting mechanism, which is capable of dynamically adjusting the weights of base clusterings and clusters. Firstly, the self-weighted framework is applied in our method to weight base clusterings automatically. Furthermore, an additional weight is assigned to each cluster in the base clustering, which can also be dynamically adjusted. This can help alleviate the issue of imbalanced clusters as well. Finally, a structured affinity graph is learned from the results of base clusterings through rank constraint and no post-processing is required. The experimental results on synthetic and real datasets illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.}

Traditional spectral clustering typically follows a two-step procedure to address the optimization problem. However, this approach may result in substantial information loss and performance decline. Furthermore, the eigenvalue decomposition, a key step in spectral clustering, entails cubic computational complexity. This paper incorporates linear embedding into the objective function of spectral clustering and proposes a direct method to solve the indicator matrix. Moreover, our method achieves a linear time complexity with respect to the input data size. Our method, referred to as Spectral Clustering with Linear Embedding (SCLE), achieves a direct and efficient solution and naturally handles out-of-sample data. SCLE initiates the process with balanced and hierarchical K-means, effectively partitioning the input data into balanced clusters. After generating anchors, we compute a similarity matrix based on the distances between the input data points and the generated anchors. In contrast to the conventional two-step spectral clustering approach, we directly solve the cluster indicator matrix at a linear time complexity. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets underscore the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed SCLE method.}

To achieve accurate performance with lightweight backbone networks, an effective Bidirectional Feature Fusion (BFF) module is designed to merge features from both RGB and depth streams, in which the cross-modal fusions and cross-scale fusions are jointly conducted to fuse the immediate features in multiple scales and multiple modals. What is more, a simple Dual Consistency Loss (DCL) function is designed to prompt cross-modal fusion by keeping the consistency between cross-modal target predictions.

Face components, such as eyes, nose, and mouth, have a shape style that is difficult to transfer. Existing methods either (1) manipulate pre-defined binary attribute labels, which is difficult to edit the shape of face components with observable changes, or (2) control the shape change by manually editing the intermediate representation (e.g., precise masks or sketches) of face components, which is time-consuming and requires painting skills. To break these limitations, we propose a simple and effective framework for diverse and controllable face component editing with geometric changes, which utilizes an inpainting model to learn the shape of face components from reference images without any manual annotations. In order to guide generated images to learn the shape style of reference face components, an example-guided attention module is designed to help the network focus on target face component regions. Moreover, a novel domain verification discriminator is introduced to pull the realism of the generated facial component close to the source face. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional methods in image quality, editing accuracy, and diversity of results (see Video Demo).}

abstract = {Current methods aggregate multi-level features or introduce auxiliary information to get more refined saliency maps. However, little attention is paid to how to obtain complete salient objects in cluttered background. To address this problem, we propose an integrity segmentation network (ISNet) with a novel detection paradigm that first separates the targets completely and then segment them finely. Specifically, the ISNet architecture consists of a target separation (TS) branch and an object segmentation (OS) branch, trained using a hierarchical difference-aware (HDA) loss. The TS branch equipped with a fractal structure is utilized to produce saliency features with expanded boundary (SF w/ EB), which can enlarge the difference of border details to separate the target from background completely. Compared with the edge and skeleton information, the SF w/ EB contains a more complete structure, which can supplement the defect of salient objects. The OS branch is leveraged to generate complementary features, which gradually integrates the SF w/ EB and aggregated features to segment complete saliency maps. Moreover, we propose the HDA loss to further improve the structural integrity of prediction, which hierarchically assigns weight to pixels according to their differences. Hard pixels will be given more attention to discriminate the similar parts between foreground and background. Comprehensive experimental results on five datasets show that the proposed ISNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Concretely, compared with three typical models, the average gain percentage reaches 2.6% in terms of FŒ≤, Sm and MAE on two large complex datasets. The improvements demonstrate that the proposed ISNet are beneficial for improving the integrity of prediction. Besides, the ISNet is efficient and runs at a real-time speed of 39.5 FPS when processing an image with size of 320 √ó 320. Furthermore, the proposed model has better generalization, which can also be applied to other vision tasks to handle complex scenes. Codes are available at https://github.com/lesonly/ISNet.}

Explicit segmentation based methods require character-level annotation during training, while implicit segmentation based methods, trained on line-level annotated data, face alignment drift challenges. Though some methods have been proposed to address these challenges using weakly supervised object detection, they often rely on cumbersome pseudo-box generation processes and complex decoding. In this paper, we propose a unified framework to overcome these challenges, achieving high accuracy in text recognition and character segmentation. To eliminate the need of character-level annotated real text line data in training, we introduce a novel training paradigm that utilizes character-level annotated synthetic data and line-level annotated real data jointly. For synthetic data, candidate characters are explicitly aligned with labeled characters to generate hard labels for supervising model training. For real data, implicit alignment is produced by Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) mapping to provide soft labels for weakly-supervised model training. And for inference, we propose two decoding strategies leveraging the advantages of Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and CTC decoding. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method in text recognition and character localization, even with minimal amounts of character-level annotated line data.}

abstract = {3D human pose estimation plays an important role in various human-machine interactive applications, but how to effectively extract and represent the kinematical features of human body structure in video has always been a challenge. This paper presents some inspiring observations on the human body properties that hold heuristic patterns of human poses: 1) There is distinct temporal coherence in any kind of human pose; 2) there exist evident spatial and temporal correlations among local joints even though the human is doing complex actions. According to the observed patterns, a locally structured feature encoder and a spatial‚Äìtemporal feature transform are proposed for kinematics-aware feature extraction and enhancement. Unlike existing works directly projecting every bone joint to pose features without distinction, the proposed locally-structured feature encoder maps the local connection property of human body structure to kinematical features which are neural embeddings extracted from both local and global groups of human bone joints. Since the local and global bone-joint groups are pre-defined according to human body kinematics, the kinematical features are able to represent body kinematics. The kinematical features are then transformed by the proposed spatial‚Äìtemporal feature transform to enhance the spatial and temporal correlations among human bone joints. The overall framework well promotes the representation of human body kinematics for 3D pose estimation. Extensive experimental results on commonly used datasets show that the mean per joint position error (MPJPE) is significantly reduced when compared with state-of-the-art methods under the same experimental condition. The improvement is expected to promote machines to better understand human poses for building superior human-centered automation systems.}

In this paper, we propose a Multi-Scale Multi-Grained (MSMG) sequential network for end-to-end person search, intended to alleviate these issues. To generate re-id representations robust to scale changes, MSMG leverages multi-scale RoI features and aggregates them with a proposed Multi-Scale feature Aggregation Encoder (MSAE). In this way, the aggregated multi-scale re-id features are enriched with more semantic information and detailed information, thereby being more discriminative for identification. Moreover, to produce re-id representations more robust to occlusions and partial instances, MSMG introduces a Multi-Grained feature Learning Decoder (MGLD) focused on multi-grained feature learning. MGLD adaptively decodes multi-grained re-id representations with more accurate semantic information through a regional deformable cross-attention module. Finally, the multi-scale multi-grained re-id representation substantially improves the identification accuracy under challenging cases. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets.

However, most existing active learning approaches estimate informativeness with uncalibrated confidence, resulting in unreliable informativeness estimation. These approaches generally ignored two significant issues caused by uncalibrated confidence methods. Firstly, the average uncalibrated confidence generated by modern neural networks is usually higher than the accuracy. Secondly, examples located near the decision boundaries are unstable during prediction when the target model updates parameters in the last several epochs, even throughout the training process. This phenomenon, caused by the forgetting characteristic of neural networks, has a significant impact on some specific models that estimate the informativeness by predicted probability vectors or pseudo labels. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel active learning approach to reliably estimate informativeness with calibrated confidence. Specifically, we integrate the intermediate predictions for each unlabeled example, generated by the target model during the training process, to generate calibrated confidence. The calibrated confidence can capture a tendentious label from an indecisive subset of the class space. We show that the calibrated confidence with tendentiousness can maintain the ability of correct predictions. The empirical results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art active learning methods on image classification tasks.}

However, a common challenge arises as most of these methods struggle to restore intricate details with vibrant colors in complex haze. In response to this challenge, we present a novel dual-path dehazing network with spatial-frequency feature fusion (DDN-SFF) to remove heterogeneous haze. The proposed dual-path network consists of a spatial-domain vanilla path and a frequency-domain frequency-guided path, effectively harnessing spatial-frequency knowledge. To maximize the versatility of the learned features, we introduce a relaxation dense feature fusion (RDFF) module in the vanilla path. This module can skillfully re-exploit features from non-adjacent levels and concurrently generate new features. In the frequency-guided path, we integrate the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and introduce a frequency attention (FA) mechanism for the flexible handling of specific channels. More precisely, we deploy a channel attention (CA) and a dense feature fusion (DFF) module for low-frequency channels, whereas a pixel attention (PA) and a residual dense block (RDB) module are implemented for high-frequency channels. In summary, the deep dual-path network fuses sub-bands with specific spatial-frequency features, effectively eliminating the haze and restoring intricate details along with rich textures. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed DDN-SFF over state-of-the-art dehazing algorithms.}

To overcome this limitation, we present an active learning-based sampling strategy that selects the most informative samples from the unlabeled candidate sample pool for expert annotation, leading to high classification performance with a reduced number of training samples. This study adopts a patch-level perspective and introduces a multi-instance learning framework for Alzheimer's Disease diagnosis. Initially, a patch pre-selection module is designed to identify pathology-prone regions while excluding background areas and irrelevant information. Subsequently, an inner-patch local attention mechanism block and an outer-patch global attention mechanism block are developed to enhance the extraction of discriminative local and global information by the network model. Finally, an active learning sampling strategy is devised to minimize the costs associated with data acquisition and expert annotation in medical domain. The effectiveness of the proposed network framework and active learning strategy was validated through four sets of control experiments on the ADNI dataset.}

abstract = {The salient object detection task is to locate and detect salient regions in images, which is widely applied in various fields. In this paper, we propose a gated progressive optimization network (GPONet) for salient object detection. Firstly, to extract salient regions more accurately, we design a multi-level feature fusion module with a gating mechanism named gate fusion network (GFN). GFN focuses on the semantic information of high-level features as well as the detailed information of low-level features, enabling purposeful delivery of high-level features to low-level features. The gate fusion unit (GFU) is also able to maintain valid information and suppress redundant information in the fusion process. Secondly, while some existing methods have shown that the additional edge supervision can facilitate salient object detection, edge pixels are often much less common than non-edge pixels, leading to the challenge of class imbalance. To overcome this issue, we introduce detail labels that provide additional internal details as a supplementary supervisory signal. Combining these labels with proposed detail perception loss (DPL) enables our network to learn edge information of salient objects more effectively. To complement each other and guide information exchange between the two branches, we propose a cross guide module (CGM) to control the information flow transfer between them. Finally, we develop a simple and efficient attention fusion strategy to merge the prediction maps of the two branches to generate the final salient prediction map. Extensive experimental results validate that our method reaches optimal or comparable performance on several mainstream datasets.

abstract = {Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization aims to generalize a model trained on source domains to unseen target domains. Recently, causality-based generalization methods have focused on learning invariant causal relationships around the label variable, as causal mechanisms are robust across different domains. However, these methods would yield an inaccurate causal variable set due to the lack of heterogeneous domain data or a prior causal structure, which severely weakens their generalization capacity. To address this problem, we propose a Causally Invariant Features Discovery (CIFD) framework, which combines causal structure discovery and causal effect estimation for selecting a high-quality causal variable set and realizing better OOD generalization. Specifically, CIFD first identifies all potential causal variables by learning a double-layer-based local causal structure around the label variable. Secondly, CIFD uses a double-layer causal effect estimator for estimating the causality of potential causal variables and obtaining true causal variables. The comprehensive experiments on both regression and classification tasks clearly demonstrate the superiority of our framework over the state-of-art methods.}

While in the model-agnostic inner loop, we use pre-existing classification models in a multi-task way and jointly update the meta-knowledge so as to help us achieve adaptive labeling on complex time series.

To address this issue, we propose a joint optimization model dubbed as ISP-IRLNet to yield optimal recovery including an interpretable sampler and a reconstructor using the implicit regularization learning network. In particular, we introduce a probabilistic distribution model of the sampling incorporated into the prior of k-space locations, which provides a robust CS-MRI sample pattern with an explicit expression. To estimate the approximating gradient in backward propagation for more stable training, we employ a differentiable binarization strategy. In addition, we unroll the ADMM optimization for solving the regularized reconstruction model to be a deep network (i.e., IRLNet) with a learnable implicit regularization sub-network to learn a regularizer or prior term implicitly. The experiments on our collected brain and public knee datasets demonstrate that our method provides an optimal sample pattern and achieves superior image reconstruction performance compared with existing methods, especially at high acceleration rates.}

Specifically, MHSAN consists of two self-attention networks. First, a global self-attention network is adopted to exploit the structure information by embedding position information of views. Then, the discriminative self-attention network learns discriminative information from the views with high classification scores. Through the proposed MHSAN, the geometric and discriminative information is condensed as the novel representation of 3D shapes. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, extensive experiments have been conducted on three 3D shape benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is generally superior to the state-of-the-art methods in 3D shape classification and retrieval tasks.}

In this paper, we propose a novel approach called overall positive prototype to effectively improve performance. Conceptually, negative samples would distribute throughout the feature space and are hard to be described. From the opposite viewpoint, we propose to construct an overall positive prototype that acts as a cohesive representation for positive samples that distribute in a relatively smaller neighborhood. By measuring the distance between a query sample and the overall positive prototype, we can effectively classify it as either positive or negative. We show that this simple yet innovative approach provides the state-of-the-art FSOR performance in terms of accuracy and AUROC.}

These modules collaborate through multiple proxy tasks, encouraging models to learn global discriminative representations and local fine-grained representations. Additionally, we introduce an efficient uniformity regularization to further enhance the learned representations. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SSMT, we conduct extensive experiments on six public Chest X-ray image datasets.

However, in this kind of solution, the noise variance (i.e., noise level) is only deployed to modulate the first layer of convolution feature with channel-wise shifting, which is limited in balancing noise removal and detail preservation. In this paper, we present a novel flexible image denoising network (CFMNet) by equipping a U-Net backbone with multi-layer conditional feature modulation (CFM) modules. In comparison to channel-wise shifting only in the first layer, CFMNet can make better use of noise level information by deploying multiple layers of CFM. Moreover, each CFM module takes convolutional features from both noisy image and noise level map as input for better trade-off between noise removal and detail preservation. Experimental results show that our CFMNet is effective in exploiting noise level information for flexible non-blind denoising, and performs favorably against the existing deep image denoising methods in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual quality.}

Many recent studies suggest using multi-domain data pooled from different acquisition sites/centers to improve statistical power. However, medical images from different sites cannot be easily shared to build large datasets for model training due to privacy protection reasons. As a promising solution, federated learning, which enables collaborative training of machine learning models based on data from different sites without cross-site data sharing, has attracted considerable attention recently. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of the recent development of federated learning methods in medical image analysis. We have systematically gathered research papers on federated learning and its applications in medical image analysis published between 2017 and 2023. Our search and compilation were conducted using databases from IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Science Direct, Springer Link, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and PubMed. In this survey, we first introduce the background of federated learning for dealing with privacy protection and collaborative learning issues. We then present a comprehensive review of recent advances in federated learning methods for medical image analysis. Specifically, existing methods are categorized based on three critical aspects of a federated learning system, including client end, server end, and communication techniques. In each category, we summarize the existing federated learning methods according to specific research problems in medical image analysis and also provide insights into the motivations of different approaches.

abstract = {Unsupervised domain adaptive person re-identification (UDA person reID) defines a task where labels in target domains are totally unknown while source domains are fully labeled. Assigning reliable labels quickly is a critical issue for UDA person reID that could be applied in the real-world scenarios. Recent studies focus on obtaining pseudo labels by clustering algorithms and then training the reID model with these labels. However, the main limitation of these methods is the high time complexity, which is caused by the calculation of all pair-wise similarities and multiple iterations in the clustering algorithm to obtain reliable results. When the data is very large or the feature dimensions are very high, the memory and time cost requirements of the clustering algorithm can increase rapidly. In this paper, we provide a fast unsupervised domain adaptive person reID framework (FUReID), which calculates the relevance between unlabeled samples only once to adapt to the new scenarios without any iterations in the stage of label generation. Especially, instead of pursuing accurate labels, FUReID considers constructing a lightweight paradigm to generate coarse labels and then refine these labels during the training stage. Therefore, FUReID designs a prototype-guided labeling method that only relies on calculating the relevance between the prototype vectors and the samples, and assigning coarse labels with noise. Then, to alleviate the issue of noise, FUReID designs a label-flexible training network with an adaptive selection strategy to refine those coarse labels progressively. For several widely-used person reID datasets, our method achieves 81.7%, 26.2%, and 87.7% in mAP on Market1501, MSMT17 and PersonX, respectively.

Considering the uncertain essence of the task, we design an uncertainty-driven method for ADL (UADL) that measures and utilizes uncertainty to evaluate unfamiliar known classes and unknown classes separately, which consists of two stages: (1) unfamiliar detection of known classes and (2) unknown detection of novel classes. In the first stage, UADL identifies unfamiliar samples of known classes via known-class uncertainty calculated by GMMs on detectors‚Äô heads. In the second stage, UADL identifies samples containing unknown classes via unknown-class uncertainty computed by class-specific GMMs in feature space. In both stages, uncertainty is used to select a minimal number of unlabeled samples for manual labeling, facilitating the model‚Äôs active self-development. Experiments on multiple object detection benchmark datasets demonstrate the feasibility and significant performance of UADL and show its effectiveness against the ADL task compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.}

The proposed SEAT is underpinned by robust theoretical justifications, in that minimizing the SEAT loss is demonstrated to promote a smoother empirical risk, consequently enhancing robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method successfully mitigates catastrophic overfitting, yielding superior performance amongst efficient defenses.

Therefore, it is necessary to enable the pre-trained model to actively select more beneficial knowledge for producing better prediction. This work proposes a novel method to help the model to Coordinate Explicit and Implicit Knowledge (CEIK) for the knowledge-based visual question answering (VQA) task, which is an important direction of pre-trained models.
