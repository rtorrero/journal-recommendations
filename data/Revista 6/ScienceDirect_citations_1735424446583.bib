abstract = {Research on unmanned aerial vehicles is growing as they are becoming less expensive and more available than before. The applications span a large number of areas and include border security, search and rescue, wildlife surveying, firefighting, precision agriculture, structure inspection, surveying and mapping, aerial photography, and recreative applications. These applications can require autonomous behavior which is only possible with a precise and robust self-localization. Until recently, the favored approach to localization was based on inertial sensors and global navigation satellite systems. However, global navigation satellite systems have multiple shortcomings related to long-distance radio communications (e.g. non-line-of-sight reception, multipath, spoofing). This motivated the development of new approaches to supplement or supplant satellite navigation. Absolute visual localization is one of the two main approaches to vision-based localization. The goal is to locate the current view of the UAV in a reference satellite map or georeferenced imagery from previous flights. Various approaches were proposed in this area and this paper review most of the literature in this field since 2015. The problematic at hand is analyzed and defined. Existing approaches are reviewed in 4 categories: template matching, feature points matching, deep learning and visual odometry.}

abstract = {This paper deals with an innovative autonomous bus navigation and parking system in a bus depot, in order to optimize their movements in a confined area. The kinematic model of the vehicle is defined. Considering its dimensions and weight as well as the centimetric accuracy required, a predictive controller is designed, based on its model linearized around the changing path curvature value, to perform accurate curved paths tracking with a limited tracking error guaranteed by the consideration of a constraint. This controller and additional sliding observers are designed according to the distance traveled, allowing maneuvers to be performed at any forward or backward speed with constant accuracy. In addition, these observers are not affected by path tracking errors. The implementation on an industrial vehicle, operated under realistic conditions, demonstrates the performance and robustness of this navigation system.}

abstract = {In order to possess a significant degree of autonomy, a robot must be able to perceive its environment and store a representation of that environment for use in tasks such as localisation, navigation, collision avoidance, and higher decision making. It must do this subject to constraints on memory and processing power typical of the embedded computer systems commonly found on small robotic devices. These constraints are particularly important for flying robots (i.e. unmanned aerial vehicles), for which weight must be minimised. The challenge of storing a detailed map of a large area on a small embedded computer has led to the development of many algorithms that exploit the sparsity of typical maps to create a more memory-efficient representation. In this paper, we demonstrate that the verticality of both natural and man-made structures can be exploited to create a framework that can store occupancy grid maps efficiently, without causing additional computational burden. The new framework achieves an order-of-magnitude reduction in memory footprint relative to widely-used occupancy grid mapping software, while also achieving a slight speed-up in map insertion and access times. We also make available LIDAR scans taken from a hexacopter of an indoor flight arena that can be used to assist in evaluating future mapping and SLAM developments.}

We use a programming-by-demonstration approach to generate training data in multiple variations (context changes) of a given task. From this data we learn a probabilistic model that maps context variables to task constraints and their respective soft task priorities. We evaluate our approach with 3 different dual-arm manipulation tasks on an industrial robot and show that it performs better than comparable approaches with respect to reproduction accuracy in previously unseen contexts.}

abstract = {Dexterous grasping is one of the most fundamental abilities of robots to implement various manipulation tasks. Robots should have the same ability as humans to plan various grasp types for dexterous grasping. This paper addresses the problem of the adaptability of grasp planning. A novel adaptive grasp planning framework is designed to adapt to various grasp types rather than a single one. In this framework, six commonly used grasp types are considered. The information of grasp type is extracted from visual data. Then, inspired by the opposition concept, a novel concept of pregrasping opposition is introduced as the pregrasping configuration to encode the information of the grasp type. After that, a two-stage adaptive grasp planning method is proposed, which determines the pregrasping opposition in Stage One and finds a feasible grasp configuration for object grasping in Stage Two. The pregrasping opposition is used as a waypoint for the formation of complex grasps. The effectiveness of the proposed framework was evaluated in simulation and real-world experiments. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed framework can plan various grasp types for dexterous robotic grasping. Additionally, the use of grasp types helps to reduce the complexity of grasp planning and improve the grasp dexterity of robotic hands.}

The wheelchair is a commercially available model that has been equipped with sensors, circuits, and batteries. The robot and wheelchair are connected when the vehicles climb a step. In that operation, the front wheels of the wheelchair are lifted and placed on the step using the velocity differences between the wheelchair and the robot. Next, when the rear wheels of the wheelchair ascend the step, the robot imitates the upper arm motions of a human pushing against his/her chest that commonly occurs when maneuvering a wheelchair up a step. Similarly, the front wheels of the robot are lifted and placed on the step using the velocity differences between the vehicles and the robot‚Äôs front wheels. After that, with the assistance of the wheelchair, the other wheels of the robot climb onto the step. In an effort to ensure safety, we also performed a theoretical analysis to determine the most suitable distance for lifting the front wheels of the robot when approaching and climbing a step. Our newly developed cooperative step-climbing system makes it possible to eliminate the complicated operations that were required by previous methods and can also prevent collisions between the wheelchair‚Äôs front wheels and the step, thus drastically improving the convenience of the operation. The test subject riding the wheelchair was an able-bodied male, and the experiment conducted to evaluate our system was performed on a 120¬†mm step height that had a friction coefficient of 0.72. This setup was sufficient for demonstrating the overall effectiveness of our system.}

abstract = {Programming a robot to deal with open-ended tasks remains a challenge, in particular if the robot has to manipulate objects. Launching, grasping, pushing or any other object interaction can be simulated but the corresponding models are not reversible and the robot behavior thus cannot be directly deduced. These behaviors are hard to learn without a demonstration as the search space is large and the reward sparse. We propose a method to autonomously generate a diverse repertoire of simple object interaction behaviors in simulation. Our goal is to bootstrap a robot learning and development process with limited information about what the robot has to achieve and how. This repertoire can be exploited to solve different tasks in reality thanks to a proposed adaptation method or could be used as a training set for data-hungry algorithms. The proposed approach relies on the definition of a goal space and generates a repertoire of trajectories to reach attainable goals, thus allowing the robot to control this goal space. The repertoire is built with an off-the-shelf simulation thanks to a quality‚Äìdiversity algorithm. The result is a set of solutions tested in simulation only. It may result in two different problems: (1) as the repertoire is discrete and finite, it may not contain the trajectory to deal with a given situation or (2) some trajectories may lead to a behavior in reality that differs from simulation because of a reality gap. We propose an approach to deal with both issues by using a local linearization of the mapping between the motion parameters and the observed effects. Furthermore, we present an approach to update the existing solutions repertoire with the tests done on the real robot. The approach has been validated on two different experiments on the Baxter robot: a ball launching and a joystick manipulation tasks.}

To reduce the computational complexity of the optimization problem, we formulate it without stabilizing terminal constraints or terminal costs.

We also provide rigorous proofs of the feasibility of the optimization problem and the stability of the proposed method. To validate the performance of our MPC method, we implement it in both 3D robot simulations and experiments with real nonholonomic WMRs for different multi-robot navigation scenarios with up to six robots. In all scenarios, the robots successfully navigate to their goal poses without colliding with one another or becoming trapped in a deadlock.}

These data often cover only a very limited set of use cases; therefore, the results cannot be generalized. Public datasets proposed until now, taken individually, cover only a few kinds of environment and mostly a single sensor. For these reasons, we developed a benchmark, for localization and mapping applications, using multiple publicly available datasets. In this way, we are able to cover many kinds of environment and many kinds of sensor that can produce point clouds. Furthermore, the ground truth has been thoroughly inspected and evaluated to ensure its quality. For some of the datasets, the accuracy of the ground truth measuring system was not reported by the original authors, therefore we estimated it with our own novel method, based on an iterative registration algorithm. Along with the data, we provide a broad set of registration problems, chosen to cover different types of initial misalignment, various degrees of overlap, and different kinds of registration problems. Lastly, we propose a metric to measure the performances of registration algorithms: it combines the commonly used rotation and translation errors together, to allow an objective comparison of the alignments. This work aims at encouraging authors to use a public and shared benchmark, instead of data collected ad-hoc, to ensure objectivity and repeatability, two fundamental characteristics in any scientific field.}

In this article, the Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance (ORCA) algorithm is modified to make it work for autonomous and decentralized collision avoidance for civil aircraft. Without considering the direction selectivity of collision-free maneuver, aircraft may select the relative parallel trajectories by deploying the ORCA algorithm in both decentralized and centralized way. As a result, the collision tends to be postponed to the next time horizon because civil aircraft need to return to original trajectories. Simultaneously, the unified rules can hardly be integrated into the approach due to the lack of direction selectivity for collision-free navigation. The process of separation assurance will be disorderly when multiple aircraft are involved. To solve the problem mentioned above, a new algorithm called Directional Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance (DORCA) is proposed. The DORCA algorithm employs a vector rotation mode to construct the forbidden Velocity Obstacle (VO) set in order to improve the computation efficiency. In addition, the direction selectivity of maneuver is achieved through constructing the direction-constrained VO set according to the direction of relative motion in velocity space. Direction selectivity of the algorithm enables the process of collision avoidance to comply with the unified rules. A number of encounter scenarios are conducted to confirm the validity and feasibility of the proposed DORCA algorithm. In all scenarios tested, the direction selectivity of collision-free maneuver can be successfully integrated into the DORCA algorithm, and the algorithm is more efficient than the ORCA algorithm for collision avoidance in decentralized way.}

We describe our novel method for online plan modification and execution monitoring, which augments an existing plan with pre-computed plan fragments in response to observed resource availability. Our plan merging algorithm uses causal structure to interleave actions, creating solutions online using observations of the true state without introducing significant computational cost. Our system monitors resource availability, reasoning about the probability of successfully completing the goals. We show that when the probability of completing a plan decreases, by removing low-priority goals our system reduces the risk of plan failure, increasing mission success rate. Conversely, when resource availability allows, by including additional goals our system increases reward without adversely affecting success rate. We evaluate our approach using the example domain of long-range autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) missions, in which a vehicle spends months at sea with little or no opportunity for intervention. We compare the performance to a state-of-the-art oversubscription planner. Planning within such domains is challenging because significant resource usage uncertainty means it is computationally infeasible to calculate the optimal strategy in advance. We also evaluate the applicability of our plan merging algorithm to existing IPC domains, presenting a discussion of the domain characteristics which favour the use of our approach.}

To generate effective robot action policies, planning and learning techniques have shown the most promising results. However, if considered individually, they present different limitations. Planning techniques lack generalization among similar states and require experts to define behavioral routines at different levels of abstraction. Conversely, learning methods usually require a considerable number of training samples and iterations of the algorithm. To overcome these issues, and to efficiently generate robot behaviors, we introduce LoOP, an iterative learning algorithm for optimistic planning that combines state-of-the-art planning and learning techniques to generate action policies. The main contribution of LoOP is the combination of Monte-Carlo Search Planning and Q-learning, which enables focused exploration during policy refinement in different robotic applications. We demonstrate the robustness and flexibility of LoOP in various domains and multiple robotic platforms, by validating the proposed approach with an extensive experimental evaluation.}

We demonstrate how such a metric can be applied to trajectory optimization and compare it against other objective functions typically used. Our results show that the trajectories computed by optimizing objectives defined as functions of the residual force polytope are more robust to unknown external disturbances. The computational cost of these metrics is relatively high and not compatible with the short planning times required by online methods, but they are acceptable for planning motions offline.}

abstract = {Most current bipedal robots were modeled with an assumption that there is no slip between the stance foot and ground. This paper relaxes that assumption and undertakes a comprehensive study of the compass gait biped on slippery ground. It presents in detail the control of a biped that allows for foot slipping, and shows that feasible gaits fail on slippery ground for two causes: falling backward or requiring negative contact force which cannot be provided by the ground. To characterize a robust gait on slippery ground, three safety factors are proposed to measure the robustness: slip friction, falling friction and tolerance ability of slipping without falling. This study thus uses these factors to investigate independent influence of gait speed and step length on the robustness of the gait, and shows that gaits with small step length and moderate speed are robust and preferable on slippery surfaces. In contrast, gaits with large step length generally require large friction to maintain stable walking on slippery surfaces. Moreover, gaits with a backward swing foot velocity relative to the ground just before touch down are generally more robust than ones with a forward velocity. It is further shown that only one parameter in gait design determines the swing-backward feature, which can help design robust gaits. Models with varying physical parameters such as mass, leg length and position of center of mass (CoM) in each leg, are also studied to validate the universality of this result.}

In this work, a double caudal fin micro-robotic fish actuated by two piezoelectric bimorph cantilevers is proposed and fabricated from rigid carbon fiber/resin composites and flexible polyimide hinges. Its weight is about 1.93 g and the maximum uniform swimming velocity is as high as about 0.75 BL/s (4.5 cm/s), which is much faster than previously reported micro-robotic fish actuated by ionic polymer‚Äìmetal composites, shape memory alloys and dielectric elastomers. A theoretical model is validated by the experimental results and can be used to design and analyze a variety of piezoelectric robotic fish propelled by caudal fins.}

In view of the fact that the mainstream multi-fingered GFO method often treats the second-order cone programming (SOCP) problem as a semi-definite programming (SDP) problem, whose computational complexity is high, we hereby use the barrier function to construct the regularized optimization problem. The trade-off representation of different dimension objective functions is given, and the penalty factor is introduced to form the augmented optimization objective function. For specific operational tasks, by adjusting the penalty factor, a more compact, stable or slack, flexible grasping scheme could be obtained. Monte Carlo simulation is used to determine the probability of successful grasping when variability is introduced, and the robustness of the proposed method in the change of contact position and the friction coefficient between hand and object is verified. Experimental results and dynamic simulation are given, which show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the mainstream SDP method in execution time and iteration number, and the obtained force distribution has both continuity and distribution. Operational flexibility is instructive for practical applications.}

Partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) provides a general model for planning under uncertainties. But a manipulation task usually have a large action space, which not only makes task planning intractable but also brings significant motion planning effort to check action feasibility. In this work, a new kind of hierarchical POMDP is presented for object manipulation tasks, in which a brief abstract POMDP is extracted and utilized together with the original POMDP. And a hierarchical belief tree search algorithm is proposed for efficient online planning, which constructs fewer belief nodes by building part of the tree with the abstract POMDP and invokes motion planning fewer times by determining action feasibility with observation function of the abstract POMDP. A learning mechanism is also designed in case there are unknown probabilities in transition and observation functions. This planning framework is demonstrated with an object fetching task and the performance is empirically validated by simulations and experiments.}

Simultaneous Localization and Mapping can be crucial to endow the robot to localize itself with accuracy and, consequently, perform tasks such as crop monitoring and harvesting autonomously. In these environments, the robotic localization and mapping systems usually benefit from the high density of visual features. When using filter-based solutions to localize the robot, such an environment usually uses a high number of particles to perform accurately. These two facts can lead to computationally expensive localization algorithms that are intended to perform in real-time. This work proposes a refinement step to a standard high-dimensional filter-based localization solution through the novelty of downsampling the filter using an online clustering algorithm and applying a scan-match procedure to each cluster. Thus, this approach allows scan-matchers without high computational cost, even in high dimensional filters. Experiments using real data in an agricultural environment show that this approach improves the Particle Filter performance estimating the robot pose. Additionally, results show that this approach can build a precise 3D reconstruction of agricultural environments using visual scans, i.e., 3D scans with RGB information.}

In this study, inspired by the nature, we developed an innovative algorithm by enhancing an existing reinforcement learning algorithm (proximal policy optimization (PPO)). Our algorithm is capable of learning to control a quad-rotor drone in order to fly. This new algorithm called Bio-inspired Flight Controller (BFC) does not use any conventional controller such as PID or MPC to control the quad-rotor drone. The goal of BFC is to completely replace the conventional controller with a controller that acts in a similar way to the animals where they learn to control their movements. It is capable of stabilizing a quad-copter in a desired point, and following way points. We implemented our algorithm in an AscTec Hummingbird quad-copter simulated in Gazebo, and tested it using different scenarios to fully measure its capabilities.}

This switching can be brittle and subject to instabilities. We present an approach to embed cyclic and point to point dynamics in a single DS. We offer a method to learn the parameters of complete DS through a two-step optimization. By exploiting Hopf bifurcations, we can explicitly and smoothly transit across periodic and non-periodic phases, linear and nonlinear limit cycles, and non-periodic phases, in addition to changing the equilibrium‚Äôs location and the limit cycle‚Äôs amplitude. We use diffeomorphism and learn a mapping to modify the learned limit cycle to generate nonlinear limit cycles.

Such data are naturally represented as Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices to capture specific geometric characteristics of the data, which increases the complexity of hard-coding them. To alleviate this difficulty, the Learning from Demonstration (LfD) paradigm can be used in order to learn robot manipulation skills with specific geometric constraints encapsulated in SPD matrices. Learned skills often need to be adapted when they are applied to new situations. While existing techniques can adapt Cartesian and joint space trajectories described by various desired points, the adaptation of motion skills encapsulated in SPD matrices remains an open problem. In this paper, we introduce a new LfD framework that can learn robot manipulation skills encapsulated in SPD matrices from expert demonstrations and adapt them to new situations defined by new start-, via- and end-matrices. The proposed approach leverages Kernelized Movement Primitives (KMPs) to generate SPD-based robot manipulation skills that smoothly adapt the demonstrations to conform to new constraints.

The key insight of the approach is that the non-convex jerk limits are transformed to linear acceleration constraints and indirectly introduced into CO as the linear acceleration constraints. In this way, the convexity of CO will not be destroyed and the number of optimization variables will not increase, which give the approach a fast computation speed. The proposed approach is implemented on random geometric path of a 6-DOF manipulator. Compared with a similar method, the results show that the torque and jerk limits are addressed by a reasonable increase in the computation time. In addition, the maximum value of joint jerk reduces by over 80% and the joint torque curves are smoother in the comparison, which demonstrates that this approach has the ability to effectively restrain acceleration mutation.}

For Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), this attribute can be an efficient factor to ensure the security and protection of the vehicle. Additionally, it extends the ADAS capabilities by creating different profiles for the drivers, which helps every driver according to his own driving style and improve the ADAS fidelity. Nonetheless, certain problems in the unpredictability of human behavior and the effectiveness of capturing the temporal features of the signal represented an ongoing challenge to accomplish driver identification.

The experiment results show that the proposed method scores 97.37% accuracy in 5cm5deg metric and 99.37% in Average Distance metric. Experiment results have shown an overall 62% relative improvement (5cm5deg metric) and 52.48% (Average Distance metric) by using the proposed method. Moreover, the pose estimation execution also showed an average improvement of 47.6% in running time.

abstract = {For sensory data fusion, a calibration method between 3D light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and color camera based on ranging statistical characteristics and improved RANSAC algorithm is proposed. The multi-frame LiDAR point cloud data of the calibration triangular board are recorded. The scanned points with close angles are defined a cluster within same degrees. Furthermore, accurate points are preserved using statistical filtering based on Gaussian distribution. Afterwards, the plane and edge parameters of the triangular board are estimated by the reserved point cloud using improved the random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm to obtain the 3D locations of the vertices. Meanwhile, corner points in the image can be extracted manually. Finally, the projection matrix between the camera and the LiDAR is estimated by using the 2D‚Äì3D‚Äã correspondences in different positions. The projection errors of different frames and corresponding points are calculated. The results demonstrate that the average error with 300 frames is reduced by 23.05% compared to 1 frame. Moreover, the standard deviation diminishes with the increasing of corresponding points. The reliability and advantage of the method are verified compared with other state-of-art methods. It provides theoretical and technical support for low resolution LiDAR.}

abstract = {This paper introduces a concept of safe path planning for UAV‚Äôs autonomous operation in an urban environment where GNSS-positioning may become unreliable or even unavailable. If the operation environment is a priori known and geo-localized, it is possible to predict a GNSS satellite constellation and hence to anticipate its signal occlusions at a given point and time. Motivated from this, our main idea is to utilize such sensor availability map in path planning task for ensuring UAV navigation safety. The proposed concept is implemented by a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) model. It incorporates a low-level navigation and guidance module for propagating the UAV state uncertainty in function of the probabilistic sensor availability. A new definition of cost function is introduced in this model such that the resulting optimal policy respects a user-defined safety requirement. A goal-oriented version of Monte-Carlo Tree Search algorithm, called POMCP-GO, is proposed for POMDP solving. The developed safe path planner is evaluated on two simple obstacle benchmark maps as well as on a real elevation map of San Diego downtown, along with GPS availability maps.}

Focusing on the recognition and localization of objects/entities, the composed map combines semantic information from publicly available, yet of lower accuracy, satellite images, with more detailed data from ground-level camera measurements. This merging is achieved by utilizing odometry information from a street-moving vehicle and the 3D reconstruction of its recorded view. Then, the 3D semantic segmentation results are georeferenced and superimposed on the semantic map from the satellite images. In such a way, areas that require fine semantic accuracy can be improved, while the rest are left with the segmentation results of the satellite information. Every part of the proposed system is individually evaluated. We additionally test the overall approach on a case-study of georeferencing new labels of traffic signs, which are detected through a specifically designed classification network over a publicly available dataset collected around the city of Berlin.}

abstract = {Hand-assistive devices are used to help post-stroke victims encumbered with hand impairments perform activities of daily living (ADL). Unlike robotic rehabilitation devices used in restricted medical conditions for designated periods, hand-assistive devices are designed to be portable and to be used for extended periods by individuals engaging in ADL. Several hand-assistive device designs have been proposed. With these, designers have focused on key elements, such as size, weight, motion profile of the fingers, and generated grip/pinch force. In this paper, we propose a unique compact hand-assistive device (CHAD) that incorporates most of these design parameters, but with less trade-offs. CHAD consists of a single unit worn on the patient‚Äôs forearm, which includes all necessary components. It is compact and does not compromise functionality. The novelty of this design can be found in the use of a unique cable-driven mechanism. This mechanism uses dual linear actuators to achieve the flexion of both the index and the middle fingers via the pull of tendon-like structures originating in two selected interphalangeal joints. This permits the numerous necessary sequences in the motion profiles of the digits. The thumb is also made able to flex with a single linear actuator. Finger extensions, in contrast, are achieved passively via adjustable flexible rubber cords joined to the dorsal side of the glove. Experimental results demonstrate that CHAD generates sufficient force and motion profiles for the comfortable execution of ADL. Additionally, CHAD produces a grip and pinch motion profile similar to that of a natural hand and does not force unwanted muscle activities.}

The method in this work, the Line‚ÄìCircle‚ÄìSquare (LCS) filter, claims that mobile robots without a large database for object recognition and highly advanced prediction methods can deal with incoming objects that the camera captures in real-time. The proposed filter applies detection, tracking and learning to each defined expert to extract higher level information for judging scenes without over-calculation. The interactive learning feed between each expert increases the consistency of detected landmarks that works against overwhelming detected features in crowded scenes. Our experts are dependent on trust factors‚Äô covariance under the geometric definitions to ignore, emerge and compare detected landmarks. The experiment validates the effectiveness of the proposed filter in terms of detection precision and resource usage in both experimental and real-world scenarios.}

Interventional techniques have emerged as a tool to handle a wide range of minimally invasive surgeries (MIS). However, current MIS procedures are constrained by the limitation of manual operation by surgeon. Thus, various microrobotic solutions including magnetic navigation systems have been proposed for MIS, which carries many potential benefits such as reduced incision, less intraoperative hemorrhaging and postoperative pain, and faster recovery time. In recent decades, many electromagnetic actuation (EMA) systems have been reported and involved to general surgery. The EMA system allows to generate efficiently magnetic source for microrobot control when its specifications are further investigated and satisfied for the desired application. To precisely manipulate the biomedical microrobot, a key issue still relies on the design of a suitable EMA platform. In this paper, we demonstrate a mathematical approach for the design configuration of magnetic system with multiple electromagnets. Especially, the required magnetic coil number has been investigated where the heading motion control, magnetic force control and their combination control are discussed respectively. The singular cases of control are pre-evaluated by a mathematical analysis of the simulated electromagnetic field. In addition, the placed positions and tilted orientations of the applied electromagnets are investigated for the optimization regarding the six typical configurations of EMA platform with 4, 6 and 8 coils. The various configurations of EMA systems have been comprehensively analyzed. Therefore, with the number of electromagnets and their optimal configuration obtained by the proposed approach, the EMA system can be initially established.}

This paper proposes to use a 4-layer LIDAR placed close to the ground to capture measurements of the road ahead of the car and allow the detection of the boundaries. This setup provides a special point of view that allows the accumulation of points on vertical surfaces on the road as the car moves, which increases the point density in vertical surfaces but keeps it limited in horizontal surfaces. This technique allows to successfully distinguish curbs from the flat parts of the road. However, this approach has some limitations, namely to detect berms, and another approach had to be developed using the gradient of point density, which extends the detection capabilities to berms and negative obstacles. This is achieved by flattening the point clouds to 2D and use traditional computer vision gradient and edge detection techniques, which also improves the processing speed. Results are obtained on the ATLASCAR real system, at different velocities, and a good performance is reached when comparing to a manually created ground truth.}

In this paper, we propose to implement robot practicing by applying statistical and reinforcement learning (RL) in a latent space of the selected skill representation. The latent space is computed by a deep autoencoder neural network, with the data to train the network generated in simulation. However, we show that the resulting latent space representation is useful also for learning on a real robot. Our simulation and real-world results demonstrate that by exploiting the latent space of the underlying motor skill representation, a significant reduction of the amount of data needed for effective learning by Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) can be achieved. Similarly, the number of RL epochs can be significantly reduced. Finally, it is evident from our results that an autoencoder-based latent space is more effective for these purposes than a latent space computed by principal component analysis.}

abstract = {This paper takes a novel look at formation control by comparing control setups based on two very different frameworks. These are applied to the distributed control of communicating omnidirectional mobile robots. One framework, which is possibly the most common approach to formation control, is based on algebraic graph theory, whereas the other, namely distributed model predictive control¬†(DMPC), is based on distributed optimization, representing a rather uncommon view on the task. In this study, formation control is understood as the task of attaining and maintaining a specific relative positioning between robotic agents while moving the formation through the environment. While interesting on its own, formation control can serve as the basis for superordinate tasks like cooperative transportation. For an encompassing treatment of the task, two different control goals are considered, resulting in different setups for each control framework. One goal consists of moving the formation‚Äôs geometric center to a specific position, whereas the other aims at letting the whole formation move with the desired velocity. In both cases, the involved robots are subject to input constraints. Already during control design, some qualitative differences between the two frameworks become apparent, with the DMPC controller exhibiting characteristic beneficial qualities in exchange for its higher computational demand. Results from various simulation scenarios confirm these observations. Considerations on the practical implementation of the two schemes, as well as hardware experiments with tailor-made mobile robots, provide valuable insight for robotics practitioners, and highlight the applicability of the two frameworks.}

Fractured femur reduction is a good candidate for robotics application owing to its elongated anatomy and strong counteracting forces from surrounding muscles. However, the robot forces should be compliant, and motions need to be accurate. Aiming to achieve these two conflicting objective, a parallel robot actuated by six intrinsically compliant actuators is being proposed here. After an initial design analysis, three performance metrics, namely, the conditioning index, actuator force index and interaction compliance index were identified and formulated. An evolutionary algorithm SPEA2 was employed to simultaneously optimize these objectives by varying the key robot design variables. Subsequent to the optimization, an optimal robot design is obtained which provides the best trade-off between the performance measures. Initial proof of concept experiments were carried out whereby the robot was tested for trajectory following accuracies while maneuvering the moving platform about the three axes. A fuzzy based closed loop feedback controller was implemented on the robot. Excellent trajectory tracking results were observed in response to the sinusoidal inputs.}

To tackle the problem, we develop a new convolutional neural network (CNN), containing two levels of subnetworks, to fuse the information in color and depth images. The first-level subnetwork generates two-dimensional (2D) human joint positions from a color image by the part-affinity-fields method. The second-level subnetwork estimates 3D human-joint positions from 2D ones and corresponding depth images. Here, strong feature-extraction function of the CNN may suppress the negative effect caused by invalid information in depth images. Meanwhile, all the estimations are implemented with the 2D CNNs, which may cause higher time-efficiency than 3D ones (mostly used in previous studies). To assess the validity, first we employed the CNN to estimate human joint positions, and obtained the accuracy and speed of respectively 90.3% and 210 ms (implemented with an affordable processing unit). Then we applied the CNN to a dual-arm nursing-care robot and found that the accuracy and processing speed satisfied the requirements in practical usage; these validated the effectiveness of our proposal and provided a new approach to generate 3D-human-joint positions through information fusion of color and depth images.}

abstract = {In the last decades, visual target tracking has been one of the primary research interests of the Robotics research community. The recent advances in Deep Learning technologies have made the exploitation of visual tracking approaches effective and possible in a wide variety of applications, ranging from automotive to surveillance and human assistance. However, the majority of the existing works focus exclusively on passive visual tracking, i.e., tracking elements in sequences of images by assuming that no actions can be taken to adapt the camera position to the motion of the tracked entity. On the contrary, in this work, we address visual active tracking, in which the tracker has to actively search for and track a specified target. Current State-of-the-Art approaches use Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques to address the problem in an end-to-end manner. However, two main problems arise: (i) most of the contributions focus only on discrete action spaces, and the ones that consider continuous control do not achieve the same level of performance; and (ii) if not properly tuned, DRL models can be challenging to train, resulting in considerably slow learning progress and poor final performance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel DRL-based visual active tracking system that provides continuous action policies. To accelerate training and improve the overall performance, we introduce additional objective functions and a Heuristic Trajectory Generator (HTG) to facilitate learning. Through extensive experimentation, we show that our method can reach and surpass other State-of-the-Art approaches performances, and demonstrate that, even if trained exclusively in simulation, it can successfully perform visual active tracking even in real scenarios.}

The results show a significant improvement when multi-goal reinforcement learning is used. Furthermore, the results of the location estimator show that a deep network can learn and generalize in different environments using camera images with high accuracy in both position and orientation.}

abstract = {Simultaneous localization and mapping is a fundamental process in robot navigation. We focus on LiDAR to complete this process in ground robots traveling on complex terrain by proposing GR-LOAM, a method to estimate robot ego-motion by fusing LiDAR, inertial measurement unit (IMU), and encoder measurements in a tightly coupled scheme. First, we derive a odometer increment model that fuses the IMU and encoder measurements to estimate the robot pose variation on a manifold. Then, we apply point cloud segmentation and feature extraction to obtain distinctive edge and planar features. Moreover, we propose an evaluation algorithm for the sensor measurements to detect abnormal data and reduce their corresponding weight during optimization. By jointly optimizing the cost derived from the LiDAR, IMU, and encoder measurements in a local window, we obtain low-drift odometry even on complex terrain. We use the estimated relative pose in the local window to reevaluate the matching distance across features and remove dynamic objects and outliers, thus refining the features before being fed to a mapping thread and increasing the mapping efficiency. In the back end, GR-LOAM uses the refined point cloud and tightly couples the IMU and encoder measurements with ground constraints to further refine the estimated pose by aligning the features on a global map. Results from extensive experiments performed in indoor and outdoor environments using real ground robot demonstrate the high accuracy and robustness of the proposed GR-LOAM for state estimation of ground robots.}

The uncertain and dynamic aspects related to ocean current movement make the trajectory prediction of drifting lost object onto sea water a very complicated task. In this work we present a novel lost target searching algorithm based on Recursive Area Clustering and target trajectory predication in ocean environment. Based on the widely known GlobCurrent v2 dataset which model the drifting of ocean surface current using satellite sensory data combined with mathematical and simulation modeling, we propose a regression algorithm based on our Recursive Area Clustering algorithm that we have developed previously to determine the strategic zones (weight centers) characterizing the high density areas extracted from drifting target history. Given those weight centers, we predict the object trajectory through refined regression. The predicted lost object trajectory is used to plan the path of UAV search mission. The model developed has a significant impact as we have tested our strategy in a scenario for searching an area covering 68517¬†km2, we have shown that 78% of the time, the lost object can be found within 32¬†km distance of the predicted trajectories limiting the significant search area to be about 5% of the whole searched area.}

The robot can easily acquire motion skills from a human tutor by kinematics demonstration, however, this becomes much more difficult when it comes to the compliant skills. This paper aims to provide a possible solution to address this problem by proposing a two-stage approach. In the first stage, the human tutor demonstrates the robot how to perform a task, during which only motion trajectories are recorded without the involvement of force sensing. A dynamical movement primitives (DMPs) model which can generate human-like motion is then used to encode the kinematics data. In the second stage, a biomimetic controller, which is inspired by the neuroscience findings in human motor learning, is employed to obtain the desired robotic compliant behaviors by online adapting the impedance profiles and the feedforward torques simultaneously. Several tests are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}

Global Positioning System (GPS) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) are well-known techniques widely used for navigation and control, respectively. This paper proposes a hybrid GPS-ANFIS based method for collision-free navigation of autonomous mobile robots. The GPS-based controller keeps the navigation direction of the robot toward the static or dynamic target. It uses the coordinates received from the two GPS modules on the edges of the longitudinal axis of the robot all together with the coordinates of the target to divert it from the current path making a certain angle towards the target. The performance of the proposed method in navigating a mobile robot in clutter environments and its effectiveness in comparison with the other collision-free navigation methods has been evaluated through simulations. The evaluation criteria are on the basis of the obstacle avoidance behavior and the length of the discovered collision-free path by the robot. The results have shown that our hybrid GPS-ANFIS method navigates the robot toward the goal via a shorter path while avoiding the obstacles.}

Of late, TMP for manipulation has attracted significant interest resulting in a proliferation of different approaches. In contrast, TMP for navigation has received considerably less attention. Autonomous robots operating in real-world complex scenarios require planning in the discrete (task) space and the continuous (motion) space. In knowledge-intensive domains, on the one hand, a robot has to reason at the highest-level, for example, the objects to procure, the regions to navigate to in order to acquire them; on the other hand, the feasibility of the respective navigation tasks have to be checked at the execution level. This presents a need for motion-planning-aware task planners. In this paper, we discuss a probabilistically complete approach that leverages this task-motion interaction for navigating in large knowledge-intensive domains, returning a plan that is optimal at the task-level. The framework is intended for motion planning under motion and sensing uncertainty, which is formally known as belief space planning. The underlying methodology is validated in simulation, in an office environment and its scalability is tested in the larger Willow Garage world. A reasonable comparison with a work that is closest to our approach is also provided. We also demonstrate the adaptability of our approach by considering a building floor navigation domain. Finally, we also discuss the limitations of our approach and put forward suggestions for improvements and future work.}

In this work, we introduce an approach that connects error in pose and success in robot manipulation, and propose a probabilistic performance measure of the task success rate. A physical setup is needed to estimate the probability densities from real world samples, but evaluation of pose estimation methods is offline using captured test images, ground truth poses and the estimated densities. We validate the approach with four industrial manipulation tasks and evaluate a number of publicly available pose estimation methods. The popular pose estimation performance measure, Average Distance of Corresponding model points (ADC), does not offer any quantitatively meaningful indication of the frequency of success in robot manipulation. Our measure is instead quantitatively informative: e.g., a score of 0.24 corresponds to average success probability of 24%.}

We discuss these methods theoretically in the context of an embedded scheduler and practically in the context of a limited CPU embedded scheduler with a nonzero scheduler runtime intended for a planetary rover. We use the concept of a commit window to enable execution of the previously generated schedule while (re) scheduling. We define Fixed Cadence and Event Driven scheduling as methods to decide when to reinvoke the scheduler. We define and analyze Flexible Execution (FE) as an approach to execute the generated schedule while adapting it to variations in execution. Specifically, FE focuses on (1) how to take advantage of activities ending earlier than expected and (2) how to maintain a consistent schedule if activities take more time than expected. We present a theoretical model and empirical results documenting how these various methods interact and perform on both synthetic data and best available data for NASA‚Äôs next planetary rover, the Mars 2020 rover.

In the context of autonomous vehicles, state-of-the-art CNNs optimize the SIDE task by producing high-quality depth maps, which are essential during the autonomous navigation process in different locations. However, such networks are usually supervised by sparse and noisy depth data, from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) laser scans, and are carried out at high computational cost, requiring high-performance Graphic Processing Units (GPUs). Therefore, we propose a new lightweight and fast supervised CNN architecture combined with novel feature extraction models which are designed for real-world autonomous navigation. We also introduce an efficient surface normals module, jointly with a simple geometric 2.5D loss function, to solve SIDE problems. We also innovate by incorporating multiple Deep Learning techniques, such as the use of densification algorithms and additional semantic, surface normals and depth information to train our framework.

Due to the difficulty in running experiments with large numbers of hardware agents, researchers often make simplifying assumptions and remove constraints that might be present in a real swarm deployment. While simplifying away some constraints is tolerable, we feel that two in particular have been overlooked: one, that agents in a swarm take up physical space, and two, that agents might be damaged in collisions. Many existing works assume agents have negligible size or pass through each other with no added penalty. It seems possible to ignore these constraints using collision avoidance, but we show using an illustrative example that this is easier said than done. In particular, we show that collision avoidance can interfere with the intended swarming behavior and significant parameter tuning is necessary to ensure the behavior emerges as best as possible while collisions are avoided. We compare four different collision avoidance algorithms, two of which we consider to be the best decentralized collision avoidance algorithms available. Despite putting significant effort into tuning each algorithm to perform at its best, we believe our results show that further research is necessary to develop swarming behaviors that can achieve their goal while avoiding collisions with agents of non-negligible volume.}

However, in long-term operations, both computational efficiency and memory requirements involved in an autonomous robot operation in uncontrolled environments, are of particular importance. The majority of approaches scale linearly with the environment‚Äôs size in terms of storage and query time. The article at hand presents an efficient appearance-based loop-closure detection pipeline, which encodes the traversed trajectory by a low amount of unique visual words generated on-line through feature tracking. The incrementally constructed visual vocabulary is referred to as the ‚ÄúBag of Tracked Words.‚Äù A nearest-neighbor voting scheme is utilized to query the database and assign probabilistic scores to all visited locations. Exploiting the inherent temporal coherency in the loop-closure task, the produced scores are processed through a Bayesian filter to estimate the belief state about the robot‚Äôs location on the map. Also, a geometrical verification step ensures consistency between image matches. Management is also applied to the resulting vocabulary to reduce its growth rate and constraint the system‚Äôs computational complexity while improving its voting distinctiveness. The proposed approach‚Äôs performance is experimentally evaluated on several publicly available and challenging datasets, including hand-held, car-mounted, aerial, and ground trajectories. Results demonstrate the method‚Äôs adaptability, which retains high operational frequency in environments of up to 13 km and high recall rates for perfect precision, outperforming other state-of-the-art techniques.

We present Visual Receding Horizon Planning (VisualRHP) in a framework which interleaves real-world execution with look-ahead planning to efficiently solve a short-horizon approximation to a multi-step sequential decision making problem. VisualRHP is guided by a learned heuristic that acts on an abstract colour-labelled image-based representation of the state. With this representation, the robot can generalize its behaviours to different environment setups, that is, different number and shape of objects, while also having transferable manipulation skills that can be applied to a multitude of real-world objects. We train the heuristic with imitation and reinforcement learning in discrete and continuous actions spaces. We detail our heuristic learning process for environments with sparse rewards, and non-linear, non-continuous, dynamics. In particular, we introduce necessary changes for improving the stability of existing reinforcement learning algorithms that use neural networks with shared parameters. In a series of simulation and real-world experiments, we show the robot performing prehensile and non-prehensile actions in synergy to successfully manipulate a variety of real-world objects in real-time.}

First, according to the mechanical structure of LHDS, the kinematics and statics models of LHDS are analyzed and obtained respectively. Based on the principle of force-based impedance control of LHDS, an impedance based motion control simulation model of LHDS is built and analyzed. The simulation results show that the dynamics characteristics have a great influence on the accuracy of impedance based motion control. Then, a dynamics compensation method considering gravity and inertia force is proposed to solve this problem. Finally, the effect of the dynamics compensation method is verified on the robot single leg test platform. The experimental results show that the compensation method reduces the negative effect of the dynamics characteristics of LHDS on impedance based motion control accuracy, and the position tracking accuracy of the robot‚Äôs foot end can be improved by more than 65%.

abstract = {Autonomous mobile robots are becoming increasingly important in many industrial and domestic environments. Dealing with unforeseen situations is a difficult problem that must be tackled to achieve long-term robot autonomy. In vision-based localization and navigation methods, one of the major issues is the scene dynamics. The autonomous operation of the robot may become unreliable if the changes occurring in dynamic environments are not detected and managed. Moving chairs, opening and closing doors or windows, replacing objects and other changes make many conventional methods fail. To deal with these challenges, we present a novel method for change detection based on weighted local visual features. The core idea of the algorithm is to distinguish the valuable information in stable regions of the scene from the potentially misleading information in the regions that are changing. We evaluate the change detection algorithm in a visual localization framework based on feature matching by performing a series of long-term localization experiments in various real-world environments. The results show that the change detection method yields an improvement in the localization accuracy, compared to the baseline method without change detection. In addition, an experimental evaluation on a public long-term localization data set with more than 10000 images reveals that the proposed method outperforms two alternative localization methods on images recorded several months after the initial mapping.}

In indoor scenarios, human movements often depend on objects with which they interacted before. For example, if a human interacts with a cup the probability that a table or coffee machine might be the next navigation goal is high. Typically, objects are grouped together in regions depending on the related activities so that environments consist of a set of activity regions. For example, a workspace region may contain a PC, a chair, and a table with many smaller objects on top of it. In this article, we present an approach to predict the navigation goal of a moving human in indoor environments. We hereby combine prior knowledge about typical human transitions between activity regions with robot observations about the human‚Äôs current pose and the last object interaction to predict the navigation goal using Bayesian inference. In the experimental evaluation in several simulated environments we demonstrate that our approach leads to a significantly more accurate prediction of the navigation goal in comparison to previous work. Furthermore, we show in a real-world experiment how such human motion anticipation can be used to realize foresighted navigation with an assistance robot, i.e. how predicted human movements can be used to increase the time efficiency of the robot‚Äôs navigation policy by early anticipating the user‚Äôs navigation goal and moving towards it.}

abstract = {Robots still cannot perform everyday manipulation tasks, such as grasping, with the same dexterity as humans do. In order to explore the potential of supervised deep learning for robotic grasping in unstructured and dynamic environments, this work addresses the visual perception phase involved in the task. This phase involves the processing of visual data to obtain the location of the object to be grasped, its pose and the points at which the robot‚Äôs grippers must make contact to ensure a stable grasp. For this, the Cornell Grasping Dataset (CGD) is used to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that is able to consider these three stages simultaneously. In other words, having an image of the robot‚Äôs workspace, containing a certain object, the network predicts a grasp rectangle that symbolizes the position, orientation and opening of the robot‚Äôs parallel grippers the instant before its closing. In addition to this network, which runs in real-time, another network is designed, so that it is possible to deal with situations in which the object moves in the environment. Therefore, the second convolutional network is trained to perform a visual servo control, ensuring that the object remains in the robot‚Äôs field of view. This network predicts the proportional values of the linear and angular velocities that the camera must have to ensure the object is in the image processed by the grasp network. The dataset used for training was automatically generated by a Kinova Gen3 robotic manipulator with seven Degrees of Freedom (DoF). The robot is also used to evaluate the applicability in real-time and obtain practical results from the designed algorithms. Moreover, the offline results obtained through test sets are also analyzed and discussed regarding their efficiency and processing speed. The developed controller is able to achieve a millimeter accuracy in the final position considering a target object seen for the first time. To the best of our knowledge, we have not found in the literature other works that achieve such precision with a controller learned from scratch. Thus, this work presents a new system for autonomous robotic manipulation, with the ability to generalize to different objects and with high processing speed, which allows its application in real robotic systems.}

We have evaluated the proposed approach first with one container from the training set and four new but similar containers. The proposed approach achieved better pouring accuracy than a regular human with a similar pouring speed for all five cups. Both the accuracy and pouring speed outperform state-of-the-art works.

The self-supervised generalization reduces the pouring error of the unaccustomed containers to the desired accuracy level.}

In this article, the landing platform‚Äôs tilting motion is considered sinusoidal type oscillatory motion for the overhead camera.

Our approach uses continuous partially observable Markov decision process (CPOMDP) planning to generate vehicle trajectories that optimally exploit imperfect detection data from onboard sensors, as well as semantic natural language observations that can be specifically requested from human sensors. The key innovations are a method for the inclusion of a human querying/sensing model in a CPOMDP based autonomous decision making process, as well as a scalable hierarchical Gaussian mixture model formulation for efficiently solving CPOMDPs with semantic observations in continuous dynamic state spaces. Unlike previous state-of-the-art approaches this allows planning in large, complex, highly segmented environments.

Multi-UAV trajectory planning is crucial for the multi-UAV system, but multi-UAV trajectory planning often needs to consider many constraints, such as trajectory smoothness, obstacle collisions, mutual collisions, dynamic limits, time-consuming, and trajectory length. It is a challenge to balance these constraints while considering computational performance. This paper proposes a novel multi-UAV trajectory planning method to solve the challenge. This method uses time segmentation instead of traditional waypoint segmentation to establish a trajectory optimization model based on the unified time interval, which simplifies the calculation of cost functions. At the same time, virtual segments are introduced to adapt to the trajectory length of different UAVs to reduce the total arrival time. Nonlinear constraints are cast into cost functions and a gradient-based sequential minimal optimization (GB-SMO) algorithm is proposed to minimize the cost function, which decouples the constraint of the mutual collisions in each iteration to save the planning time. Experiments are performed on a multi-UAV system to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results show that this method has good performance in obstacle-rich environments and is efficient for a large number of UAVs.}

The framework accomplishes planning via a structured predictive control strategy that combines the use of heterogeneous simplified models over different prediction time scales. A receding multi-horizon predictive controller coordinates the approach before the jump using a kinematic point-mass model. Consideration of the optimal value function over different planning horizons enables the system to select an appropriate number of steps to take before jumping. The jumping motion is then tailored to the sensed obstacle by solving a nonlinear trajectory optimization problem. The solution of this problem online is enabled by exploiting the analyticity of the flow map for a planar bounding template model under polynomial inputs. By planning with this combination of models, MIT Cheetah 2 is shown to autonomously jump over obstacles up to 40¬†cm in height during high-speed bounding. Untethered results showcase the ability of the method to automatically adapt to obstacles of different heights and placements in a single trial.}

Furthermore, mobile robots open up the possibility for automated radiological field surveys and monitoring operations, which have important applications in scenarios with CBRN threats. A path planner is one of the essential tools required for these robots to perform their tasks autonomously. Moreover, sophisticated path planners can greatly increase the efficiency of monitoring tasks by maximizing the information gathered in the minimum amount of time. This work proposes an informative path planner as an instrument to efficiently estimate maps of scalar quantities (e.g., radiation intensity, chemical concentration), motivated by applications in radiological inspection. The proposed path planner models the path with B-splines, enabling planning in continuous space. A Gaussian Process with a squared exponential kernel is used to model the underlying field. A modified form of mutual information, estimated from the Gaussian Process, is maximized to determine the most informative path, additionally rewarding observations made in regions where the field magnitude is large (e.g., near a radioactive source). A maximum likelihood estimator for source parameters is used to demonstrate that the proposed solution increases the accuracy of the estimated source positions. Simulation results show that the informative path planner adapts to non-convex environments and increases the number of observations made close to radioactive sources while avoiding obstacles.}

We build upon our previous work, where we showed that a lidar pipeline can be used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based pipeline to interpret radar data, which is useful when conditions then become unfavourable to the original lidar pipeline. In this paper, we test the method on a wider range of conditions, such as from a moving vehicle, and with multiple people present. Additionally, we also compare how the traditional SVM performs interpreting the radar data versus a modern deep neural network on these experiments. Our experiments indicate that either of the approaches results in progressive improvement in the performance during normal operation. Further, our experiments indicate that in the event of the loss of information from a sensor, pedestrian detection and position estimation is still effective.}

Two types of IL models are inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) and behavioral cloning (BC). Models trained under IRL traditionally perform better than those trained under BC due to compounding covariate shift associated with the latter, which typically requires algorithms such as DAGGer to help compensate for this. More recently, however, deep learning architectures with increased generalization performance have been developed, which may help to alleviate the problem of compounding covariate shift and allow researchers to take advantage of the simplicity of BC. Despite these developments, recent studies on BC in sub-scale autonomous robots employ relatively primitive convolutional networks without such tools as batch normalization and skip connections, and it is difficult to judge their networks‚Äô performance relative to others due to drastically different training and testing conditions. Here, we examine how an array of artificial neural networks, chosen to reflect more recent architectural choices available, behave in a highly controlled IL task ‚Äì navigating around a small, indoor racetrack ‚Äì upon being embedded in a sub-scale RC vehicle as an end-to-end steering system. For our main findings, we report the lap completion rate and path smoothness of each network under the exact same conditions as it controls the vehicle on the track. To supplement these findings, we also measure each network‚Äôs bias toward the distribution of the training actions and develop a method to highlight regions of a given input image that are deemed ‚Äòimportant‚Äô to a given network. We observe that most of the more recent neural networks perform reasonably well during testing, as opposed to the more primitive networks which did not perform as well.

abstract = {Balancing two-wheeled autonomous vehicles at low forward speeds is one of the primary challenges in the development of such vehicles. Gyrostabilizers can be used as actuators to make the balance; however, conventional gyros are not typically able to maintain constant moments and directions to stabilize against constant ‚Äòheel‚Äô. In this paper, we present an innovative gyrostabilizer including a twin-flywheel arrangement that can provide any desired gyroscopic roll moment. The dynamical model of a bicycle together with the gyrostabilizer is derived using Newton‚ÄìEuler method. The actuator dynamics is included when designing the control system. A robust non-integer sliding mode controller is then developed to guarantee perfect trajectory tracking in the presence of roll disturbance. Extensive comparative simulations (based on the experimentally measured parameters of a typical bike) are conducted to evaluate the method and to show the impact of introducing the novel actuator. Results demonstrate that the proposed system offers superior performance while the control effort also remains within the capacity of normal actuators.}

abstract = {Inspired by the abilities of amoeba to alter their shape, a continuous-track robot called Ourobot has been developed that is able to adapt its shape to the environment. Using tactile sensors at the outer hull of the robot, the outline of the terrain and collisions with obstacles can be detected. Thus, the robot is able to locomote in uneven terrain and climb steep slopes. Since the shape adaption is based on run-time optimization, the quality function can be easily expanded to consider additional side conditions. The functionality of the proposed approach is demonstrated both in simulation and hardware.}

abstract = {Accurate robot localization represents a challenge inside pipes due to the particular conditions that characterize this type of environment. Outdoor techniques (GPS in particular) do not work at all inside metal pipes, while traditional indoor localization methods based on camera or laser sensors do not perform well mainly due to a lack of external illumination and distinctive features along pipes. Moreover, humidity and slippery surfaces make wheel odometry unreliable. In this paper, we estimate the localization of a robot along a pipe with an alternative Radio Frequency (RF) approach. We first analyze wireless propagation in metallic pipes and propose a series of setups that allow us to obtain periodic RF spatial fadings (a sort of standing wave periodic pattern), together with the influence of the antenna position and orientation over these fadings. Subsequently, we propose a discrete RF odometry-like method, by means of counting the fadings while traversing them. The transversal fading analysis (number of antennas and cross-section position) makes it possible to increase the resolution of this method. Lastly, the model of the signal is used in a continuous approach serving as an RF map. The proposed localization methods outperform our previous contributions in terms of resolution, accuracy, reliability and robustness. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the RF-based strategy without the need for a previously known map of the scenario or any substantial modification of the existing infrastructure.}
