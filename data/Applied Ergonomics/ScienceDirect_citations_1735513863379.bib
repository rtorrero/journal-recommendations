abstract = {To make graphical user interfaces look more fashionable, designers often make use of high-stroke-contrast fonts. We are yet to understand how these fonts affect reading. We examined the effect of letter-stroke contrast on three bold fonts, one with extreme contrast between thick and thin strokes, one with no contrast, and one in between. The fonts were designed for this experiment to enable control of font variables. Participants identified the middle letter in a lowercase letter trigram in each trial, briefly presented in the parafovea (at 2° left and right of fixation) and at the foveal fixation point. There was evidence for letter recognition impairment for the font with high stroke contrast compared to the fonts with low and medium stroke contrast, while there was no significant difference in performance between the medium- and low-stroke-contrast fonts. The results suggest that bold fonts with high stroke contrast should not be considered for designs where letter recognition is a priority.}

The study identified and reviewed the findings of 24 systematic reviews or meta-analysis and 6 longitudinal studies. Publications were systematically searched in several databases from 1966 to January 2021. To summarize the level of evidence, a best evidence synthesis was performed, and the quality of included studies was rated. High job demands, high job strain, high effort/reward-imbalance and low social support showed a strong evidence to increase the risk for musculoskeletal disorders. In addition to job demands and job strain, low perceived fairness proved to be a risk factor of absenteeism with strong evidence. Due to the small number of studies, no reliable evidence assessment for workplace accidents was possible. The summarized findings can improve risk assessment methods, by providing a systematic estimation of the potential risk severity of psychosocial work characteristics and assist practitioners in further developing the psychosocial risk assessment.}

Four types of commercially available metacarpal gloves were selected for evaluation in a randomized controlled trial. Evaluations included turning and placing tests, also grip, pinch, and screwdriver tests, and rating of the perceived level of effort. Dexterity test results showed that metacarpal gloves significantly reduced the ability to perform motor tasks requiring coordination compared to bare hands. Hand functions such as gripping, pinching, and forearm rotations were not significantly affected. However, the perceived level of effort needed to complete those hand functions increased as the metacarpal glove's bulkiness increased. High levels of mechanical protection typically offered by metacarpal gloves can inversely affect hand dexterity and hand exertion.}

A reluctance to utilize automated functionality within the optronics system has been due to operator familiarity with legacy manual procedures based upon the use of a physical periscope. This highlights the gap that is prevalent between innovation, design, training and governance of automation utilization. The current work examined current (Control group) utilization of optronics technology using an expert population in a high fidelity simulator.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the physiological impact of multiple days of military load carriage by addressing the hypothesis: A second day of load carriage increases oxygen uptake and reduces knee extensor torque compared to a single day of load carriage. A load carriage group (n = 12) (carrying 32 kg) and unloaded group (n = 14) walked on a treadmill for 2 h on two consecutive days. Knee extensor and flexor torque were assessed by dynamometry at speeds of: 0°·s−1,60°·s−1 and 180°·s−1 before and after load carriage on day one and two, and 24 h following day 2. Oxygen uptake was assessed via respiratory gas assessment at the 6th and 119th minute of load carriage on day one and two. When assessed by mixed methods ANOVA (alpha: 0.05), an interaction effect was observed for oxygen uptake (p < 0.001), with post hoc assessment highlighting second day of load carriage significantly increased oxygen uptake compared to day one post in the loaded group (28.9(3.0) vs 25.8(3.4), p = 0.048). An interaction effect was observed for all knee extensor variables (all p < 0.05). All knee extensor peak torque variables were significantly associated to oxygen uptake at 0°s−1 (r = −0.576, p < 0.05), 60°s−1 (r = −0.552, p < 0.05), and 180°s−1 (r = −0.589, p < 0.05). Two days of load carriage significantly increases oxygen uptake and reduces knee extensor and flexor torque compared to a single day of load carriage. Subsequently, physical training programmes aimed at increasing knee extensor strength may protect against increases in oxygen uptake.}

The biodynamic response of the hand arm system is affected by several influencing factors. These influencing factors include the feed force, body posture, gripping force, and anthropometric properties. In present studies the importance of the gripping force on the biodynamic response is highlighted. In the state of the art; however, the magnitude of gripping forces as well as the influence of the human factors body posture and feed force on hammer drills for a larger group of professional users is unclear. To analyze the influence that these human factors have on hammer drill vibrations, a study with 15 professional power tool test personnel has been conducted. Characteristic gripping force values have been measured (Median: 84 N–156 N at the main handle, 10 N–30 N on the auxiliary handle) for different feed forces (100 N, 150 N, 200 N) and body postures. Then the influence of body posture, feed force, and gripping force on the hammer drill vibration is determined. A significant influence of the body posture (ANOVA: p = .003, r = .367) on the RMS acceleration of the main handle was observed. Furthermore, the feed force has a significant influence on the vibration of the hammer-drill for some groups. The data also demonstrates that for increasing gripping forces, the RMS of the acceleration and frequency weighted acceleration ahv on the main and auxiliary handle decrease. The findings of this study represent a starting point for the development of adjustable hand-arm models for the reproducible vibration assessment of power tools.}

Twenty-four firefighters participated in the test in a driving simulator. The results show that the CSWS was effective in issuing preemptive warnings when the drivers were approaching curves with unsafe speed during emergency responses. Drivers reduced their driving speed at curve approaching and entering phases for most challenging curves, without affecting the overall time in completing the test route. Drivers had reduced number of severe braking and decreased average in-curve distance traveled over the safety speed limits, when the CSWS was in use. Drivers also rated the CSWS as assisting, effective and useful. In summary, the CSWS can enhance firetruck safety during emergency driving without sacrificing drivers’ precious response time.}

Results suggest that before reducing or removing auditory alarms from the clinical environment to improve patient safety, it is important to understand how nurses in different clinical contexts use current alarm systems to extract meaningful information. Such an understanding could guide appropriate alarm reduction strategies and guide alternative design solutions to support nurses' situation awareness during monitoring.}

This study sought to confirm the previous deductively-developed soma-semiotic framework, whose purpose was to understand and ultimately predict the emotional impact of different design elements on users, using one specifically designed object, Fruit Bowl (FB). The purpose of the study reported in this paper was to compare the theoretically derived emotional responses to FB from the soma-semiotic framework with empirically derived data from users in order to improve the framework. Sixty participants evaluated the meaning and emotion conveyed by FB as well as self-reported their own experienced emotions under two scenarios. The framework predicted that FB would convey joy in a first scenario, and amusement in a second scenario based on different movements. Using a weighted vector analysis based on Russell's two-dimensional Circumplex of emotions, users identified that the overall emotion of the first scenario to be similar to the predicted emotion. This was attributed mostly to the bouncy movement of the bowl and its visual aesthetic. However, in the second scenario the overall rating was calm/impressed; rather than humour. The abstract design did not favour users making the same associations as the designer. We recommend that the soma-semiotic framework be revised to include aesthetic, in addition to semiotic and semantic, elements as determinants of user interpretations and reactions to designed objects.}

Five emergent themes for walker user perception and spatial use were identified, from which design considerations were distilled and then categorised into 10 design elements. The study highlights differences between the requirements for accommodating walkers and those for accommodating wheelchair users. It provides new insights into improved housing design for older adults, which have the potential to be incorporated into existing frameworks for accessible design and universal design thereby improving the independence and safety of older adults.}

To determine how anthropometric characteristics cluster in the New Zealand Defence Force, and to describe the characteristics of each cluster. This information can inform the development of new uniform sizing systems for the New Zealand Defence Force.
Methods
Anthropometric data (n = 84 variables) from 1,003 participants (212 females; 791 males) in the New Zealand Defence Force Anthropometry Survey (NZDFAS) were used. The dataset was stratified by gender and variables isolated based on their relevance to shirt and trouser sizing. Principal Component Analysis was used to identify the most important variables for clustering. A combination of two-step and k-means clustering was used to derive cluster characteristics.
Results
The PCA identified optimal clothing (shirt = body height and waist girth; and trouser = inseam length and hip girth for females; inseam length and waist girth for males) variables. Two-step and k-means clustering identified optimal cluster numbers of 6 and 10 for female and male clothing, respectively. The female clothing clusters were more variable (intra-cluster) and further apart (inter-cluster) compared to males.
Conclusions
Anthropometric measurements in combination with clustering techniques show promise for partitioning individuals into distinct groups. The anthropometry dimensions associated with each cluster can be used by the garment industry to develop specific sizing systems for the New Zealand Defence Force population.}

Eighteen licensed operators and two experts assessed team performance in six nuclear control room scenarios. The results reveal an overall agreement between operators and experts, measured by the intraclass correlation coefficient, ranging from 0.60 to 0.70, which lies close to the intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.75 for the experts. This demonstrates potential for achievement of relatively accurate operator self-assessment for complex work. The agreement varied in a similar manner for both expert agreement and operator-expert agreement across eight performance dimensions. In addition, the operators’ self-assessment provided additional information beyond observer assessment in identifying non-acceptable performance items.}

Pearson's correlations and ordinary least products regression were used to assess relationships between tasks and tests. Performance on reconstructions, subject-matter expert and participant ratings were combined to derive minimum acceptable job performance levels, which were used to determine cut-scores on appropriate correlated simulations and tests.
Results
The majority of performance times were highly correlated with their respective simulations (range of r: 0.73–0.90), with the exception of those replicating water rescue (r range: 0.28–0.47). Regression compatibility intervals provided three cut-scores for each job-task on an appropriate simulation and fitness test.

Participants (n = 29) were randomized to stair walking or sedentary control and concomitantly wore RFID tags at the hip, chest and neck. An accelerometer worn at the hip captured criterion physical activity data. RFID devices detected sedentary control and stair walking participants (mean RFID detections: 15.50, 47.33 respectively). Neck lanyard RFID tags were detected most frequently. RFID correctly classified all participants in both groups. RFID-based energy expenditure estimates were strongly correlated with accelerometer estimates (r = 0.78–0.94). Percent agreement for floor detection between the Bluetooth and RFID readers (38.6%) was consistent with known limitations of Bluetooth proximity sensing.

abstract = {A behaviourally-anchored observational rating scale (BAORS) of teamwork based upon the ‘Big Five’ teamwork model (Salas et al., 2005) was selected and adapted for use in a combat training setting – a UK military field gun competition. The teamwork development of 16 newly-formed teams training to master a historic tactical drill was evaluated over the course of a week-long residential programme. Training culminated in a timed field gun competition. Teams were trained and mentored in respects to teamwork and taskwork by experienced military instructors. Teamwork was assessed at the outset and end of training. Significant improvements were evident on all teamwork process dimensions, with the greatest improvement seen in teams' shared understanding of teamwork roles and strategies (shared mental models). The lack of an association between teamwork development and final drill performance is explored, as is the utility of the measurement protocol developed for teamwork assessment in other settings.}

abstract = {Human movement is characterized by its variability: the same task is never performed twice in exactly the same way. This variability is believed to play a functional role in movement performance and adaptability, as well as in preventing musculoskeletal damage. This article focuses on the time-evolution of movement variability throughout a repetitive pointing task until exhaustion. The kinematics of 13 subjects performing the pointing task is analyzed. Principal Component Analysis of joint angles identifies joint coordinations for each pointing cycle, and cycle-by-cycle comparison highlights movement variability. Non-supervised clustering reveals that subjects adopt successive coordination patterns at an intra-individual level. Inter-individual variability is characterized by the number and type of such patterns: from 3 to 5 patterns, mobilizing the trunk, the shoulder and the upper limbs differently. Movement variability exists even in a seemingly basic and constrained task. It appears in the very early stages of fatigue onset, and may correspond to adaptative coordination responses throughout task performance. This observation should encourage workstation designers to better account for movement variability in order to preserve operators' health and safety.}

Two Kinect-based biomechanical models - mechanical energy (KineticE) and work (WorkE) were employed to estimate the energy expenditure during four Wii™ exergame session. Consequently, two stepwise regression models were developed from nineteen participants’ data and then validated by five holdout participants. The data collected using an accelerometer (r = 0.835, p < 0.001) had the highest correlation as compared to that of the WorkE (r = 0.805, p < 0.001) and KineticE (r = 0.466, p < 0.001) correlations with the reference indirect calorimetry using Quark activity energy expenditure (QuarkAEE). The regression results show that KineticE and the weight of the participant were significant factors for mechanical energy prediction (AEEKinetic). However, according to the work prediction equation (AEEWork), only WorkE was significant. The new energy prediction models showed significant agreement with the standard QuarkAEE (AEEKinect, r = 0.641, p = 0.02; AEEWork, r = 0.793, p < 0.001), and they were comparable to accelerometer predictions (r = 0.682, p = 0.001). The findings indicate that Kinect can be a potentially viable alternative to measure energy expenditures. The models can be applied with higher accuracy, especially when the activity demands high body movements.}

Independent of Joint-Hardness and Target Torque the Atlas Copco TurboTight® and Cleco Low Torque Reaction fastening strategies, both using a rapid spindle-head rotation strategy, produced the lowest peak and impulse force, respectfully, when compared to the 2 tools that were designed to fasten with a longer duration.

However, it has also been associated with inducing upper body musculoskeletal disorders amongst surgeons due to their propensity to assume non-neutral postures. Further, there is a perception that patients with high body mass indexes (BMI) exacerbate these factors. Therefore, surgeon upper body postures were objectively quantified using inertial measurement units and the LUBA ergonomic framework was used to assess posture during laparoscopic training on patient models that simulated BMIs of 20, 30, 40 and 50 kg/m2. In all surgeons the posture of the upper body significantly worsened during simulated laparoscopic surgery on the BMI 50 kg/m2 model as compared to the baseline BMI model of 20 kg/m2. These findings suggest that performing laparoscopic surgery on patients with high BMIs increases the prevalence of non-neutral posture and may further increase the risk of musculoskeletal disorders in surgeons.}

Anatomical alignment of rotator cuff muscles makes them the most vulnerable to injuries during overhead work. In this study, the effect of task rotation, as one of the administrative controls to reduce the risk of injury during overhead work, on the fatigue response of rotator cuff muscles was investigated. Twelve participants performed three submaximal exertions (5, 20, and 35% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC)) using four task rotation sequences (increasing, decreasing, upward parabolic, and downward parabolic). Median frequency of surface electromyography (EMG), shoulder strength, and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were used to study the fatigue response of rotator cuff muscles. Although the average normalized muscle activity was similar in all sequences, the task rotation sequence had a significant effect on the median frequency. The effect of task rotation sequence on the strength and RPE was similar to that of the median frequency but was statistically not significant. The upward parabolic task rotation sequence resulted in the lowest fatigue among all the task sequences. Performing intense exertions apart from each other, warm-up exertions, and the presence of active recovery after the intense exertions could be the factors that produced the lowest fatigue during this sequence.}

Soldiers are required to conduct tasks and operations in physically demanding situations, where the ability to move (mobility) quickly is important to lethality and survivability. This study employed a specially designed suit to try to isolate the main mass property characteristics of personal protective clothing/equipment (PPCE) including mass, bulk and stiffness as much as possible and evaluated their effects on soldier performance across operationally-relevant mobility tasks.
Method
Eight male military subjects performed the load effects assessment program (LEAP) obstacle course while wearing 7 different configurations of specifically designed suit: unencumbered (control), 10 kg mass, 30 kg mass, 20 L bulk, medium stiffness, high stiffness and a mixed configuration consisting of 10 kg mass, 20 L bulk and medium stiffness. The primary outcome measure was total LEAP completion time. Additionally, heart rate, rating of perceived exertion (RPE), range of motion and vertical jump heights were measured and related to LEAP performance.
Results
All configurations degraded or tended to degrade the total LEAP completion times (p-value < 0.05), except for the medium stiffness configuration. Heart rate did not differ significantly between configurations, while RPE scores of configurations 30 kg and mix were significantly higher compared to control (p < 0.01).
Conclusion
Mass, bulk and stiffness all negatively influence LEAP obstacle performance. Therefore, all three have to be considered when trying to reduce the physical burden on soldiers.}

The main purpose of this study was to explore the neural mechanism of attention capturing of the anthropomorphic app icons based on neuroergonomics. Participants' perception of different app icons was investigated by using event-related potentials (ERPs) and attractiveness evaluation. The results showed that anthropomorphic app icons were evaluated more attractive and elicted larger P2, P3 and LPP amplitude than non-anthropomorphic app icons, which indicated an attention bias to attractive anthropomprphic app icons. The time course of the attention towards anthropomorphic app icons includes three main processes: an early stimulus-driven perceptual detection of app icon features (P2 during 160–200 ms), an involuntary allocation of attention to evaluate and categorize app icons (P3 during 300–500 ms), and experiencing different emotions to anthropomorphic versus non-anthropomorphic app icons (LPP during 500–800 ms). That is, the process of users’ perception and attention toward app icons combines “bottom-up” and “top-down” processes. Our findings suggest a new perspective to use ERP components (P2, P3, and LPP) to deep understanding of app icon design. A practical implication is that app icons could be designed using anthropomorphic elements to attract users.}

To determine how well decision tree models can predict tailor-assigned uniform sizes using anthropometry data from the New Zealand Defence Force Anthropometry Survey (NZDFAS). This information may inform automatic sizing systems for military personnel.
Methods
Anthropometric data from two separate samples of the New Zealand Defence Force military were used. Data on Army personnel from the NZDFAS (n = 583) were used to develop a series of shirt- and trouser-size prediction models based on decision trees. Different combinations of physical, automatic, and post-processed measurements (the latter two derived from a 3D body scan) were trialled, and the models with the highest cross-validation accuracy were retained. The accuracy of these models were then tested on an independent sample of Army recruits (n = 154).
Results
The automated measurement method (measurements derived automatically by the body scanner software) were the best predictors of shirt size (58.1% accuracy) and trouser size (61.7%), with body weight and waist girth being the strongest predictors. Clothing sizes that were incorrectly predicted by the model where generally one size above or below the tailor-predicted size.
Conclusions
Anthropometry measurements, when used with decision tree models, show promise for classifying clothing size. Methodological changes such as fitting gender-specific models, using additional anthropometry variables, and testing other data mining techniques are avenues for future work. More research is required before fully automated body scanning is a viable option for obtaining fast and accurate clothing sizes for military clothing and logistics departments.}

abstract = {Purpose
Nonlinear analysis techniques provide a powerful approach to explore dynamics of posture-related time-varying signals. The aim of this study was to investigate the fundamental interactions between postural variability structure and discomfort development during prolonged standing.
Methods
Twenty participants, with equal distribution for gender and standing work experience (SWE), completed a simulated long-term standing test. Low back and legs discomfort, center of pressure, lumbar curvature, and EMG activity of trunk and leg muscles were monitored. Nonlinear measures including largest lyapunov exponent, multi-scale entropy, and detrended fluctuation analysis were applied to characterize the variability structure (i.e., complexity) in each signal. The size (i.e., amount) of variability was also computed using traditional linear metrics.
Results
With progress of low back and legs discomfort over standing periods, significant lower levels were perceived by the participants having SWE. The amount of variability in all signals (except external oblique EMG activity) were significantly increased with the time progress for all participants. The structure of variability in most signals demonstrated a lower complexity (more regularity) with fractal properties that deviated from 1/f noise. The SWE group showed a higher complexity levels.
Conclusions
Overall, the findings verified variations in structure and amount of the postural variability. However, nonlinear analysis identified postural strategies according to the perceived discomfort in a different way. These results provide supports for future application of nonlinear tools in evaluating standing tasks and related ergonomics interventions as it allows further insight into how discomfort development impact the structure of postural changes.}

It also fits current concerns about climate change and general sustainability. However, our understanding of the characteristics of sustainable communities is still insufficient, as is evidenced by the different perspectives extant in the HFE literature. This paper provides a further perspective based on systems ergonomics, intended both to extend our socio-technical understanding and to assist HFE practitioners in contributing to a broad approach by which to contribute to the never-ending renewal process for these communities. Without such an approach many communities will become unsustainable, with collapse as their end, as Tainter originally, icily, explained (Tainter 1988). The paper begins with a definition of a ‘sustainable community’, including its legal basis. Its sustainability goals are outlined, based mainly on principles of social justice, since without people there is no community. Then there is a discussion of the characteristics of sustainable communities, the classes of resources available to maintain sustainability, and some of the complexities and hindrances to this maintenance. The last sections link this conceptual landscape to HFE practice by outlining approaches and processes that move from the conceptual landscape in this paper to current practice.}

NASA Task Load Index scores indicated that the urban traffic-noise control increased mental demand compared to PSel slow-tempo music. In the PSel slow-tempo condition, less use was made of the brake pedal. When compared to extroverts, introverts recorded lower mean speed and attracted lower risk ratings under PSel slow-tempo music.

abstract = {Descriptions of resilient performance in healthcare services usually emphasize the role of skills and knowledge of caregivers. At the same time, the human factors discipline often frames digital technologies as sources of brittleness. This paper presents an exploratory investigation of the upside of ten digital technologies derived from Healthcare 4.0 (H4.0) in terms of their perceived contribution to six healthcare services and the four abilities of resilient healthcare: monitor, anticipate, respond, and learn. This contribution was assessed through a multinational survey conducted with 109 experts. Emergency rooms (ERs) and intensive care units (ICUs) stood out as the most benefited by H4.0 technologies. That is consistent with the high complexity of those services, which demand resilient performance. Four H4.0 technologies were top ranked regarding their impacts on the resilience of those services. They are further explored in follow-up interviews with ER and ICU professionals from hospitals in emerging and developed economies to collect examples of applications in their routines.}

The objectives of this study are to develop an on-the-hand method for evaluating vibration-reducing (VR) gloves, and to determine whether VR gloves can significantly reduce the vibration exposures. A worker holding and pressing a typical workpiece (golf club head) against a grinding wheel or belt in order to shape the workpiece was simulated, and the input vibration and those on the workpiece and hand-arm system were measured. Ten human subjects participated in the experiment. The results demonstrate that VR gloves significantly reduced the vibrations at the palm, hand dorsum, and wrist. The grinding interface condition and hand feed force did not substantially affect glove effectiveness. The use of gloves slightly increased the workpiece resonant response, but the resonant response did not significantly affect glove effectiveness. This study concluded that the use of VR gloves can help control vibration exposures of workers performing grinding of handheld workpieces.}

Using the exoskeleton significantly and partially clinically relevant reduced median/peak activity of the erector spinae (≤6%), biceps femoris (≤28%), rectus abdominis (≤6%) and increased median/peak activity of the vastus lateralis (≤69%), trapezius descendens (≤19%), and median knee (≤6%) and hip flexion angles (≤11%).

The findings imply the exoskeleton particularly supports hip extension and requires an adjusted body posture during lifting with different styles and orientations. The potential of using exoskeletons for primary/secondary prevention of musculoskeletal disorders should be investigated in future research including a greater diversity of users in terms of age, gender, health status.}

Many of these studies have indicated the importance of an external Human-Machine Interface of communication (eHMI) on autonomous vehicles to indicate their intentions to other road users. Using an experimental design, we compared three eHMIs coupled to three road infrastructures to observe pedestrians' crossing behavior and collect their feelings about different vehicle types. Our results showed that the eHMIs influence the pedestrians' decision to cross the street, confirming the importance of setting up eHMIs. The proportion of pedestrians who crossed in front of the autonomous vehicles was more significant for vehicles equipped with an eHMI than vehicles without an eHMI. In 10% of cases, pedestrians used circumvention strategies rather than crossing in front of a vehicle without an eHMI. This behavior was more often observed when there was no protected infrastructure. Finally, while our objective data failed to indicate whether a specific eHMI is better accepted than another, the subjective data on the participants' preferences provided some promising ideas for further studies and the eHMI final implementation.}

abstract = {Hand anthropometry is one of the fundamentals of ergonomic research and product design. Many studies have been conducted to analyze the hand dimensions among different populations, however, the definitions and the numbers of those dimensions were usually selected based on the experience of the researchers and the available equipment. Few studies explored the importance of each hand dimension regarding the 3D shape of the hand. In this paper, we aim to identify the dominant dimensions that influence the hand shape variability while considering the stability of the measurements in practice. A novel four-step research method was proposed where in the first step, based on literature study, we defined 58 landmarks and 53 dimensions for the exploration. In the second step, 80,000 virtual hand models, each had the associated 53 dimensions, were augmented by changing the weights of Principle Components (PCs) of a statistical shape model (SSM). Deep neural networks (DNNs) were used to establish the inverse relationships from the dimensions to the weight of each PC of the hand SSM. Using the structured sparsity learning method, we identified 21 dominant dimensions that represent 90% of the variance of the hand shape. In the third step, two different manual measuring methods were used to evaluate the stability of the measurements in practice. Finally, we selected 16 dominant dimensions with lower measurement variance by synthesizing the findings in Step 2 and 3. It was concluded that the recognized 21 dominant dimensions can be treated as the reference dimensions for anthropometric study and using the selected 16 dominant dimensions with lower measurement variance, ergonomists are able to generate a 3D hand model based on simple measurement tools with an accuracy of 5.9 mm. Though the accuracy is limited, the efforts are minimum, and the results can be used as an indicator in the early stage of research/design.}

The purpose of this study was to systematically compare the relevance of substituting driver cues with an external human-machine interface among SDVs (no eHMI vs. eHMI) with the relevance of substituting engine sound with artificial sound among (H)EVs (no engine sound vs. engine sound). In a within-subject design, twenty-nine participants acting as pedestrians encountered a simulated SDV in a parking lot. The results revealed that both informational cues have equally large effects on subjective measures such as perceived safety. In semi-structured interviews, participants stated that it is equally crucial to equip SDVs with an eHMI as equipping (H)EVs with an artificial sound generator. We conclude that an eHMI for SDVs seems to be as relevant as an artificial sound for (H)EVs.}

Sitting in the dynamic condition resulted in lower pain ratings (p = 0.031), decreased calf circumference (p < 0.001), lower average seat pressure (p < 0.001), and greater seat contact area (p = 0.003) compared to the control.

It is critical to consider the unintended impact technology can have on human operators particularly regarding information flow and interactions within teams. Previous research revealed that the co-location of operator's dependent on each other for task relevant information can optimise information flow previously constrained by engineering considerations. The current work compared a novel circular configuration to that of a contemporary submarine control room. In the circular configuration, consoles faced inwards, permitting eye contact between operators, and three large screen displays were introduced to provide all operators with the same information. Ten teams participated in low and high demand dived tracking scenarios in a simulated submarine control room. All communications between operators were recorded in order to generate social, information, and task networks. These were statistically compared to networks generated from a baseline study of contemporary operation. Overall, the volume of verbal communications significantly reduced, information exchange was more structured, and the volume of tasks completed by operators significantly increased when operating in an inward facing circle configuration. The current work provides support for a data driven evidence-based approach to design that is information centric but endorsed by the end user to optimise performance and increase productivity. Implications of the work and future research ideas are discussed.}

This research investigates the effect of playing on three different key width size pianos (5.5-inch octave, 6.0-inch octave and conventional size with 6.5-inch octave) on hand, arm and shoulder muscle activity levels according to the hand size of the pianists. Results indicate that piano key size affects the muscle activity levels of selected muscles. Furthermore, this effect of different key sizes changed according to the players’ hand spans. Small-handed pianists may benefit from using smaller-sized keyboards to reduce muscular exertion during performance. This investigation provides preliminary EMG data supporting the use of different size keyboards to improve the ergonomic fit according to the dimensions of individual pianists.}

Hazard identification is an essential first step in remediating STF hazards and creating a safer work environment. Previous research has identified industry-specific risk factors for STFs, evaluated exposures to those risk factors, and developed taxonomies of the hazards for the construction and farming sectors. In comparison, ErgoMine–a mobile device application-based ergonomics audit tool–is the only systematic evaluation tool that covers STF hazards in the mining industry. However, ErgoMine was not specifically developed to address STF hazards. This paper describes the development of a taxonomy that helps identify STF hazards at surface mining sites and provides recommendations to address these hazards to inform future evaluation tools. The objective was to develop a taxonomy that was self-explanatory, observable, repeatable, and solution oriented. In addition to current regulations, standards and guidelines were used to develop the taxonomy to ensure the focus was beyond basic compliance. A detailed description of how the STF hazard taxonomy was created for walkways, stairways, and fixed ladders is provided, along with two specific applications of its use. The STF hazard taxonomy can be used to develop tools like checklists and ergonomics audits to identify and remediate slip, trip, and fall hazards at surface mining facilities, thereby improving worker safety.}

Their ubiquity means that even incremental improvements can have significant benefits for patient care. However, solutions have proven challenging for multiple reasons—including issues of backward compatibility inherent in changing any standard. Here we present a series of three experiments showing that manipulations to one specific, understudied property can significantly lower alarm annoyance without harming learning or memory—while preserving an alarm's melodic and rhythmic structure. These results suggest promising new directions for improving the hospital's soundscape, where evidence of problems related to sound are increasingly recognized as affecting medical outcomes as well as physician well-being.}

A dynamic, electromyography-assisted spine model was employed that indicated statistical, but marginal, biomechanical benefits of the tested exoskeleton, which diminished with the introduction of the cognitive dual-task. Using Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based brain connectivity analyses, we found that the tested exoskeleton imposed greater neurocognitive and motor adaptation efforts by engaging action monitoring and error processing brain networks. Collectively, these findings indicate that a wearer's biomechanical response to increased cognitive demands in the workplace may offset the mechanical advantages of exoskeletons. We also demonstrate the utility of ambulatory fNIRS to capture the neural cost of HEI without the need for elaborate dual-task manipulations.}

Increments in asymmetry led to large increases in mediolateral shear, while load mass and asymmetry had significant effects on anteroposterior shear. Increased deposit height led to higher shoulder forces, while the horizontal location mostly affected the forces in the knees and shoulders.

We examined the effects of font width on EMs by utilizing four fonts, from the Univers family, which varied in letter-width magnitude. Participants’ (n = 25) reading speed, saccade velocity, and the duration/number of fixations and saccades were recorded. The Ultra Condensed font significantly influenced readability and yielded: fewer fixations and saccades; longer fixation durations than the Roman and Extended fonts; and shorter saccade durations, relative to the other fonts. Readers efficiently adjusted their EMs such that no reading-speed differences were observed. The eye-tracking metrics revealed two trade-off effects: (1) fewer and shorter EMs and (2) more and longer EMs, which were revealed by the font-width manipulation.}

abstract = {The introduction of automated vehicles (AVs) into urban areas initially leads to mixed traffic, consisting of AVs, human drivers, and vulnerable road users. Since the AV's passenger is no longer actively involved in the driving task, there may be changes in the interaction between AVs and surrounding human road users. Therefore, it is essential for an AV to behave in a comprehensible manner in order to maintain or even enhance traffic efficiency and traffic safety. This work investigates the interaction of an AV and a simultaneously oncoming human driver at road bottlenecks due to double-parked vehicles on both sides of the road. Based on findings derived from AV-pedestrian interaction, comfort limits in terms of driving dynamics, and traffic observations, we designed nine AV movements to either yield the right of way or to insist on it by varying the AV's speed (maintain speed, one-step deceleration, two-step deceleration) and its lateral offset (no offset, close offset, distant offset). The different vehicle movements were evaluated with 34 participants in a driving simulator study. The results show participants' shorter passing times, fewer crashes, and significantly higher ratings of the AV's communication if the AV movement contained a lateral offset. In addition to the regular encounters, we analyzed the controllability of an automation failure and its aftereffect on participants' trust in AVs. The experience of the automation failure reduced the trust rating significantly. From the results we conclude that the AV should communicate the right of way not only via speed adjustments but also via the performance of a lateral offset to enhance traffic efficiency and safety. Moreover, a change in the AV's maneuver due to an automation failure must be avoided since it is not controllable by the human driver.}

Repetitive motion is one of the main risk factors associated with these conditions. Several efforts have been made within the scientific community in order to develop specific methods to assess the risk that repetitive work represents. Furthermore, internationally coordinated work has resulted in the generation of a series of ISO standards to address issues around ergonomics in the workplace. In 2012, Chile adopted the ISO11228-3 standard checklist in its regulatory process, creating the first technical standard of risk management for repetitive motion. The aim of this study is to present the results of a nation-wide online survey of Chilean Health and Safety Practitioners and Ergonomists, which was conducted in order to identify their level of application experience, most commonly adopted practices, and opinions on the first Chilean Standard for WRMSDs-ULs risk assessment. A second aim is to discuss common issues and possible improvements in public policies, and the adoption of international instruments by developing countries. A total of 331 respondents completed the survey (183 Ergonomists and 148 non-ergonomist). It was observed that a number of the participants consider that the adaptation of the ISO standard has several issues, ranging from simple ones as wording and format to more complex ones regarding overall structure, logic, and ease of use. One of the main issues expressed is the fact that during the adaptation process the instrument is applied in multitask jobs, without providing clear instructions or training. Furthermore, among the top three most used assessment methods were RULA and REBA, which are posture-driven, instead of methods validated for repetitive motion. The issues detected by the Chilean OHS practitioners are common in developing countries, where an intersection of lack of resources, public agency authoritarianism, and poor communication between public-private and public-public organizations contribute to poor consultation, validation, and adaptation processes. Suggestions to improve the current Chilean standard, as well as considerations for developing countries, are presented.}

The aim of this study was to assess current perceptions of heat stress, fatigue and recovery practices during active duty in Australian firefighters.
Design
Prospective survey.
Methods
473 firefighters from Fire and Rescue New South Wales completed a two-part, 16-item survey. Questions included perceptions of the operational activities and body areas associated with the most heat stress, the most mentally and physically demanding activities, and levels of fatigue felt. Further questions focussed on the use and importance of recovery practices, effectiveness of currently used heat-mitigation strategies and additional cooling strategies for future use.
Results
Around a third of firefighters (62%) reported structural fire-fighting as the hottest operational activities experienced, followed by bushfire-fighting (51%) and rescue operations (38%). The top three responses for which body-parts get the hottest ranked as ‘the head’ (58%), ‘the whole body’ (54%) and ‘the upper back’ (40%), respectively. The majority of firefighters (~90%) stated they always or sometimes use the opportunity to recover at an incident, with the top three being ‘sit in the shade’ (93%), ‘cold water ingestion (drinking)’ (90%) and ‘removing your helmet, flash hood and jacket’ (89%). Firefighters reported higher usefulness for more easily deployed strategies compared to more advanced strategies. Limited age and gender differences were found, although location of active service differences were present.
Conclusion
These findings may inform future research, and translation to operational directives for recovery interventions; including exploration of protective gear and clothing, education, resources and provision of cooling methods, as well as recovery aid development.}

Current gait analysis methods require overly complicated instrumentation and have not been tested for external factors such as walking surfaces that are encountered in the real-world, thus the results are difficult to extrapolate to real-world situations. Artificial intelligence approaches (in particular deep learning networks of varied architectures) to analyze data collected from wearable sensors were used to identify irregular surface exposure in a real-world setting. Thirty young adults wore six Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors placed on their body (right wrist, trunks at the L5/S1 level, left and right thigh, left and right shank) while walking over eight different surfaces commonly encountered in the living community as well as occupational settings. Three variations of deep learning models were trained to solve this walking surface recognition problem: 1) convolution neural network (CNN); 2) long short term memory (LSTM) network and 3) LSTM structure with an extra global pooling layer (Global-LSTM) which learns the coordination between different data streams (e.g. different channels of the same sensor as well as different sensors). Results indicated that all three deep learning models can recognize walking surfaces with above 0.90 accuracy, with the Global-LSTM yielding the best performance at 0.92 accuracy. In terms of individual sensors, the right thigh based Global-LSTM model reported the highest accuracy (0.90 accuracy). Results from this study provide further evidence that deep learning and wearable sensors can be utilized to recognize irregular walking surfaces induced motion alteration and applied to prevent falling injuries.}

A common method used for supplementing visual feedback in these cases is a hand-held telescopic mirror, but that involves working with both arms extended overhead, and is often accompanied by awkward neck and shoulder postures. A video camera was considered as an alternative to using a mirror for visual feedback and reducing overhead reach. A mirror, a borescope and an omnidirectional camera were evaluated while laboratory participants performed three one-handed simulated manufacturing tasks in a small overhead enclosure. Videos were recorded for quantifying the time that postures were assumed while performing the tasks. The average time that both arms were above mid-shoulder height for the omnidirectional camera was more than 2.5 times less than for the mirror and borescope. The average proportion of neck strain time was 0.01% (or less) for both the omnidirectional camera and the borescope, compared to 83.68% for the mirror. No significant differences were observed in task completion times between the three modalities. Hence, an omnidirectional camera can provide visibility while reducing straining postures for manufacturing operations involving overhead work.}

The independent variables were the vibration position (three levels of stimulus, i.e., wrist, shin, and upper jaw) and response effector (two levels, i.e., hand and foot). Experiment Tasks 1 and 2 measured participants’ simple reaction time and choice reaction time, respectively, when providing vibration warnings in non-driving situations. The results demonstrate that the vibration on the upper jaw has the shortest simple reaction time and choice reaction time. The effect of stimulus-response consistency on choice reaction time was insignificant. Task 3 was similar to Task 2, with the exception of simulated driving. Compared to the result in Task 2, the choice reaction time in Task 3 was approximately 200 ms longer. Vibration of the upper jaw was reported to have the highest perceived intensity and preference.

Manipulation was enhanced when they transmitted the optimal force to the tips when closing, the bottom chopstick was stabilized when opening, and the upper chopstick was encouraged to rotate moderately. In addition, opening chopsticks is more difficult than closing them. Square chopsticks increase the force of the tips, whereas octagonal chopsticks encourage more rotation of the upper chopstick, indicating that differences in the ability to manipulate chopsticks during development affect the preference for cross-sectional shapes.

abstract = {Background
Effective shooting performance relies heavily on sufficient grip strength. However, some standard issue pistols used by police services may have a trigger weight that causes problems for officers with insufficient grip strength, including female officers. The current study aimed to replicate previous findings, which show that grip strength is positively related to shooting performance. We also sought to determine what grip strength is required to achieve proficient scores on a standard police pistol qualification (PPQ) when a heavy trigger weight (i.e., 8lbs–12lbs) is used. Finally, we explored the relationship between officer gender and PPQ scores to determine if grip strength plays a mediating role in this relationship.
Method
The dominant hand grip strength (in lbs) of 86 male and 32 female officers were recorded prior to their participation in their agency mandated annual PPQ. Officer gender, grip strength, and PPQ scores were analyzed to explore how they related to one another.
Results
Grip strength significantly impacted officers’ ability to pass the PPQ, with female officers possessing lower grip strength compared to male officers, as well as achieving poorer scores on the PPQ. We determined that grip strengths in the range of 80lbs and 125lbs were needed to score approximately 85 % and 90 % on the PPQ, respectively; exceeding that of the average grip strength for the female officers in the study (M = 77.5lbs). Mediation analysis suggested that grip strength may mediate the relationship between officer gender and shooting performance, but studies with more power are needed to confirm that.
Conclusion
To improve shooting performance as well as public and police safety, law enforcement agencies may need to consider including grip strength training in their conditioning regime or examine the adoption pistols with a lighter trigger pull weight (e.g., 6lbs).}

abstract = {Objective
Identify whether contextual information may unintentionally alter decision-making during lethal force training.
Background
Lethal force decisions inherently involve a threat assessment, where an individual learns to identify a threat and use force commensurate to the situation. This decision is ultimately subject to numerous cognitive influences, particularly during training where artificial factors may bias decision-making.
Method
Participants made threat assessments for tasks that presented hostile stimuli (pointing guns) and non-hostile stimuli (holding cell phones). Experiment 1 identified issues in target design by applying scoring rings as cues to targets, whereas Experiment 2 used bullet holes to assess cues due to target reuse. Experiment 3 applied these cues equally to hostile and non-hostile stimuli to prevent a predictive relationship from forming.
Results
Significant cueing effects were observed in both Experiments 1 and 2. For Experiment 3, response times were not impacted by the invalid cues as participants could no longer reliably use the cue to distinguish between hostile and non-hostile stimuli.
Conclusion
Stimulus-related factors can unintentionally create predictive relationships during lethal force training. These predictive factors are problematic because they allow participants to make threat assessments during training in a way that would never be realistic in the field.
Application
Modifications should be made to hostile and non-hostile targets in equal measure to avoid creating an unintentionally predictive relationship that identifies hostile targets. In practice, scoring rings and bullet holes should be added to non-hostile stimuli to better parallel hostile stimuli.}

In this study, Pressure Discomfort Threshold (PDT) and Pressure Pain Threshold (PPT) were measured for two hundred eighteen healthy Chinese adults at seventy-six anatomical locations, and further statistical analyses were performed on the acquired data to understand the relationship between different demographic parameters. The results suggest that the pressure sensitivity is low in the vertex region, moderate in the forehead and temporal area, and high in the facial and nasal region. From this study, pressure sensitivity maps were developed for PDT and PPT for Chinese adults. The measured pressure threshold data showed no significant relationship with age and Body Mass Index (BMI).}

Thirteen anthropometric measures, forearm electromyography from flexor carpi radialis (FCR) and extensor carpi radialis (ECR), and maximal isometric wrist flexion/extension torque were obtained from 25 male participants. Pearson correlation coefficients assessed relationships between peak isometric torque and: (1) anthropometrics, (2) FCR and ECR activation, (3) FCR/ECR antagonist/agonist coactivation ratios. Based on significant correlations, linear regression equations were developed (SPSS v.25; p < 0.05). Hand thickness, forearm circumference and ECR activation or hand thickness, elbow circumference, FCR activation and body weight were most highly correlated with extension or flexion torque, respectively. Hand thickness, forearm circumference, and ECR activation (R2 = 54.5%; p = 0.001) and hand thickness, elbow circumference, FCR activation (R2 = 68.3%; p < 0.001) explained similar variance in torque regressions as did the addition of body weight to extension (R2 = 58.0%; p = 0.001) and flexion (R2 = 69.9%; p < 0.001) torque regression equations, respectively. Circumference measurements, a pseudo for muscle size, and activation amplitude influenced wrist force output more than limb length or coactivation.}

This study aims to verify the hypothesis that high-density surface electromyography (HDsEMG) allows an optimized discrimination of risk levels associated with different fatiguing lifting conditions compared to traditional bipolar sEMG. 15 participants performed three lifting tasks with a progressively increasing lifting index (LI) each lasting 15 min. Erector spinae (ES) activity was recorded using both bipolar and HDsEMG systems. The amplitude of both bipolar and HDsEMG can significantly discriminate each pair of LI. HDsEMG data could discriminate across the different LIs starting from the fourth minute of the task while bipolar sEMG could only do so towards the end. The higher discriminative power of HDsEMG data across the lifting tasks makes such methodology a valuable tool to be used to monitor fatigue while lifting and could extend the possibilities offered by currently available instrumental-based tools.}

The proposed design process analyzes the characteristics of product design, user, task, and use context, the types of preferred grip posture, the preference distribution of grip posture, and the preference distribution of hard-key area, and then recommends the locations of hard keys by considering the preference distribution of hard-key area and design constraints. The proposed design process was applied to a smartphone with a 5-inch screen, resulting in 77–96 mm from the bottom of the device for a volume key to 20 mm on the left side and 88–97 mm for a power key to 10 mm on the right side.

The novelty here was to assess DRES before and after the task and across three missions. Overall, students were found to change their perceptions from threat to challenge over time. Also, increased DRES were positively correlated with performance progressing from mission to mission, indicating that the students reflect on their performance as they advance in their training. These findings show that individual metacognitive evaluations of a stressful aviation maneuver might be important for the progress in performance. The results are discussed in terms of flight safety and pilot training.}

Results from both experiments confirm that smartphone display size does impact user perceptions of size, such that larger displays cause users to significantly underestimate the size of objects. This effect held when target items were presented alone, or concurrently with a non-target referent. This is the first study to confirm such an effect and suggests that the size of a smartphone display can negatively influence the accuracy of users’ visual perception. Thus, beyond aesthetics or cost, it must be realized that the choice of device might have additional perceptual consequences for consumers.}

Simulated stroke sessions were conducted with 27 caregivers, who subsequently completed a survey measuring workload, usability, and teamwork. Follow-up interviews with each caregiver ascertained how telemedicine affected workflow and demands which were analyzed for barriers and facilitators to using telemedicine. Caregivers experienced moderate workload and rated team effectiveness and usability high. Barriers included frustration with equipment and with the training of caregivers increasing demands, the loss of personal connection of the neurologists with the patients, and physical constraints in the ambulance. Facilitators were more common with live visual communication increasing teamwork and efficiency, the ease of access to neurologist, increased flexibility, and high overall satisfaction and usability. Future research should focus on eliminating these barriers and supporting the distributed cognition of caregivers.}

The current study aimed to determine which AV behaviours contribute to pedestrians' judgements as to whether the vehicle is driving manually or automatically as well as judgements of likeability. We tested five target trajectories of an AV in curves: playback manual driving, two stereotypical automated driving conditions (road centre tendency, lane centre tendency), and two stereotypical manual driving conditions, which slowed down for curves and cut curves. In addition, four braking patterns for approaching a zebra crossing were tested: manual braking, stereotypical automated driving (fixed deceleration), and two variations of stereotypical manual driving (sudden stop, crawling forward). The AV was observed by 24 participants standing on the curb of the road in groups. After each passing of the AV, participants rated whether the car was driven manually or automatically, and the degree to which they liked the AV's behaviour. Results showed that the playback manual trajectory was considered more manual than the other trajectory conditions. The stereotype automated ‘road centre tendency’ and ‘lane centre tendency’ trajectories received similar likeability ratings as the playback manual driving. An analysis of written comments showed that curve cutting was a reason to believe the car is driving manually, whereas driving at a constant speed or in the centre was associated with automated driving. The sudden stop was the least likeable way to decelerate, but there was no consensus on whether this behaviour was manual or automated. It is concluded that AVs do not have to drive like a human in order to be liked.}

Results showed a strong curvilinear relationship where high TSA accuracy resulted in higher performance in some areas of air combat, measured with friendly losses and kills.

This study conducted in the United States explored whether presenting public report information within narratives and with tests of healthcare quality metrics supported the public report sensemaking process. The study involved 200 participants and employed a 2 (public report information presented in the standard format, presented within a narrative) * 2 (no tests of quality metrics added to standard report, metrics tests added) between-subjects experimental design. The participants viewed the scenario of a patient looking for dialysis facility-related information. They were then asked which dialysis facility they would choose for their care and their level of confidence in their choice. Subsequently, a knowledge quiz evaluating how the participants interpreted the information presented to them, the NASA-TLX workload survey, and a usability questionnaire were administered. The results showed that the probability of choosing the better facility from the perspective of the quality measures included in the report changed from 0.69 to 0.89 when information was presented within a narrative rather than with the standard public report format. The results also found a significantly higher comprehension score (M = 54.58, SD = 18.51) when information was presented within the narrative than when presented in the standard public report format (M = 44.57, SD = 25.13). When information was presented to the participants within a narrative, the narrative may have enabled the participants to visualize themselves as the person depicted in the narrative and this may have increased the perceived relevance of the quality measures. Total workload, mental demand and perceived usability were higher when information was presented within the narrative than when presented in the standard format. The high workload and mental demand may be due to the stress placed on the information processing channels while reading a narrative and the effort expended to relate it to the quality measures. They may also be markers of more deliberative decision making facilitated by the narratives. No significant effect of tests of quality metrics was found on the dependent variables of choice of the better healthcare facility, comprehension, and usability. There was also no significant effect of quality metrics tests on overall workload. However, the effect of quality metrics tests on the mental demand subscale of NASA-TLX was significant. Mental demand was higher without quality metrics tests than with quality metrics tests. No significant interaction was found between the two independent variables on the dependent variables of choice of the better healthcare facility, comprehension, workload, and usability. It is recommended that narratives be used to present public report information to support informed healthcare decisions.}

Self-reported cybersickness ratings were recorded from 77 participants viewing two variants of a 360-degree hazard test: hazard perception and hazard prediction. The latter was hypothesised to be particularly susceptible as clips abruptly cut to a probe question at hazard onset. Such sudden occlusions are thought to increase cybersickness. Overall cybersickness levels were low, with only four participants excluded for above-threshold sickness ratings. The remaining participants showed unexpectedly lower symptoms for the hazard prediction test and rated this test format as more comfortable and engaging. These findings mitigate concerns over the use of 360-degree videos in formative hazard assessments, even when clips involve sudden occlusions. Nonetheless, removal of any participants due to cybersickness raises problems for using VR for formal assessments of hazard perception skill.}

In this study, 23 healthy volunteers in ergonomic and non-ergonomic workstations completed the Montreal imaging stress task, while their brain activity was recorded using the synchronized measurement of electroencephalography and functional near-infrared spectroscopy. The results revealed desynchronization in alpha rhythms and oxygenated hemoglobin, as well as decreased functional connectivity in the PFC networks at the non-ergonomic workstations. Additionally, a significant increase in salivary alpha-amylase activity was observed in all participants at the non-ergonomic workstations, confirming the presence of induced stress. These findings suggest that workstation design can significantly impact cognitive functioning and human capabilities at work.

abstract = {Care transitions that occur across healthcare system boundaries represent a unique challenge for maintaining high quality care and patient safety, as these systems are typically not aligned to perform the care transition process. We explored healthcare professionals' mental models of older adults’ transitions between the emergency department (ED) and skilled nursing facility (SNF). We conducted a thematic analysis of interviews with ED and SNF healthcare professionals and identified three themes: 1) ED and SNF healthcare professionals had misaligned mental models regarding communication processes and tools used during care transitions, 2) ED and SNF healthcare professionals had misaligned mental models regarding healthcare system capability, and 3) Misalignments led to individual and organizational consequences. Overall, we found that SNF and ED healthcare professionals are part of the same process but have different perceptions of the process. Future work must take steps to redesign and realign these distinct work systems such that those involved conceptualize themselves as part of a joint process.}

Sixteen male firefighters completed a simulated intervention under three different conditions: 1) during the day with a sound alarm signal (DaySA), 2) during the night with a sound alarm signal (NightSA), 3) during the night with a vibrating alarm signal (NightVA). Cardiovascular and psychological stress were recorded throughout the interventions. During the alarm signal, HR reactivity was greater in NightSA than in DaySA (p < 0.01). Parasympathetic reactivation and self-confidence were significantly lower in NightSA than in DaySA (p < 0.05). HR reactivity was decreased in NightVA in comparison to NightSA (p < 0.05). Overall, the rescue intervention had a greater impact on the psychophysiological variables during the night than during the day, and the type of alarm had a minor effect.}

Thirty healthy participants were recruited: fifteen healthy females and fifteen healthy males. Participants worked at a computer workstation (1-h per chair). Equipment included: Pressure pads, Electromyography, Near–Infrared Spectroscopy, and Questionnaires (rate of perceived discomfort, seating discomfort questionnaire and exit survey). A significant increase in anterior–posterior postural sway was found on the seat pan with the use of the AC1. An increase in neuromuscular activity of the external obliques and an increase change in total oxygen index (%TOI) values in the gastrocnemius were also found using the AC1, however the difference was not much higher than the NAC and AC2. Lower discomfort scores in the gluteal area were found with the use of active chair AC1 compared to the NAC. Preliminary findings suggest that having an office chair with a split seat pan design shows potential to yield biomechanical and physiological benefits for the sitter, however further research is needed to better understand the ergonomic benefits of active sitting.}

In the second study, participants performed a simulated full case replenishment task in which they lifted boxes weighing between 2.7 and 10.9 kg from a cart into a flow rack. Shelf height significantly affected all postural and EMG variables and there was a trade-off between back and shoulder muscle activity across the varying shelf heights. Together, these studies were used to develop some general ergonomic slotting guidelines that could be implemented to reduce biomechanical load exposures experienced by distribution center workers.}

The present research aimed to investigate how these techniques facilitate mental processing of users' visual search in high information-density visual environments. In Experiment 1, 60 participants performed 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-icon visual search tasks. The search times significantly increased as the number of icons increased with the SHD but not with the BHD. In Experiment 2, 40 participants performed a 49-icon visual search task. The search time was faster, and the fixation spatial density was lower with the BHD than with the SHD. These results suggested that the BHD supported parallel processing in the highlighted area and serial processing in the broader display area; thus, the BHD improved search performance compared to the SHD, which primarily supported serial processing.}

abstract = {Recently, motion-based navigation interfaces have been widely utilized in virtual reality (VR) environments. However, improper navigation interfaces can negatively impact the VR experience, and because different interfaces have different characteristics, the navigation experience may vary. Although comparative studies have been conducted with various interfaces, information obtained by focusing on qualitative evaluation was limited. Thus, this study explores the effects from three navigation interfaces (walking-in-place (WIP), joystick, and teleportation) on user performance, sense of presence, workload, usability, and motion sickness through a mixed-method design. Twenty-one participants were asked to perform a navigation task using selected navigation interfaces. The results indicated different advantages and disadvantages in the navigation interfaces for each evaluation metric. In particular, it was found that more research on user safety is required for the WIP interface. The findings of this study are expected to contribute to the development of guidelines for applying navigation interfaces to specific VR environments.}

However, they have increasingly been seen as a nuisance. Beyond their negative aspects, a study has yet to comprehensively evaluate train horn effectiveness and understand if they remain beneficial and relevant in the contemporary environment. Hence, this study aimed to provide evidence on the actual use of train horns. Field observations were conducted at 54 railway crossings across four Australian States. The effects of level crossing type, location, and environmental conditions were investigated in relation to train horn loudness as objectively measured at the crossing. Results revealed that train horns were not always used, presenting an issue for passive level crossings. However, when sounded, train horn use was redundant and insufficiently loud at level crossings equipped with bells. Taken together, current train horn practice was found to be highly variable and dependent on crossing type, remoteness, and individual train drivers, thus resulting in inconsistent warnings and raising important implications for standardisation.}

Experimental results showed that both slider design and length significantly affected the accuracy, task completion time and subject preference. Compared with the traditional slider design, the modern slider design showed significantly smaller bias in setting values, shorter task completion time, and higher subject preference. The slider length significantly affected all measures, and 5.8 cm was recommended due to small bias, short task completion time, dominant preference and excellent ability to closely fit the width of smartphone display with the portrait mode. These findings could provide mobile VAS and slider designers with useful references.}

GRF traditional parameters were evaluated by two-way ANOVAs. GRF and kinematic waveforms were assessed using a statistical parametric mapping (SPM) method (two-way ANOVA). No interaction effects were observed between footwear and load. GRF at the beginning of stance was lower while wearing the SBR boot condition compared to the PU boot condition. Load carriage increased trunk, hip, and knee flexion. The analyzed military boots did not affect movement patterns during loaded walking and the military boot with SBR midsole material reduced impact to a greater extent. The study demonstrated that the design and materials (e.g., midsole material and thickness) used in boot manufacturing can influence military boot performance.}

Although the effectiveness and advantages of the phishing susceptibility measures in the signal detection theory (SDT) framework have been verified, the cognitive mechanisms that lead to individual differences in these measures remain unknown. The current study proposed and examined a theoretical path model to explore how the Big Five personality traits, related knowledge and experience and the cognitive processing of emails (i.e., mail elaboration) influence users’ susceptibility to phishing emails. A sample of 414 Chinese participants completed the 44-item Big Five Personality Inventory (BFI-44), Mail Elaboration Scale (MES), Web Experience Questionnaire, Experience with Electronic Mail Scale, Knowledge and Technical Background Test and a demographic questionnaire. The phishing susceptibility measures were calculated after the participants finished an email legitimacy task in a role-playing scenario. The results showed that the general profile of the “victim personality” included low conscientiousness, low openness and high neuroticism, and Internet experience and computer and web knowledge played an important role. All of these factors have significant indirect effects on phishing susceptibility by influencing mail elaboration. Moreover, the probabilities of checking for further information or deleting the email reflect the sensitivity of email judgment. These findings reveal the mediating role of cognitive processing between individual factors and phishing susceptibility. The theoretical implications of this study for the phishing susceptibility literature and its applications to phishing risk interventions or training programs are discussed.}

Each subject wore an eye-marking recorder, and gaze points were recorded and analyzed. No significant relationship between task duration and gaze pattern was observed. However, there was a significant relationship between a surgeon's years of experience and the percentage of time spent gazing at the forceps. Subjects with more years of experience operated without looking at the forceps and fixed their gaze on the operational target. Therefore, when analyzing laparoscopic gazing patterns, it may be more appropriate to define an “expert” based on the years of experience rather than task duration.}

Using data on these 134 barriers and facilitators, we distinguish 25 components of workflow integration of the CDS, which are described according to four dimensions of workflow integration: time, flow, scope of patient journey, and level. The proposed definition and conceptual model of workflow integration can be used to inform health IT design; this is the purpose of the proposed checklist that can help to ensure consideration of workflow integration during the development of health IT.}

Task performance and task performance degradation are assessed for three levels of workload. Previous studies have evaluated task performance using these modalities however, only a couple have evaluated task performance under varying workload. Even though speech is a common addition to modern control interfaces, the effect of varying workload on this combination of control modalities has not yet been reported. Thirty-six participants commanded simulated aircraft through generated obstacle courses to reach a Combat Air Patrol (CAP) point while also responding to a secondary task. There were nine conditions that varied the control modality (Keyboard and Mouse (KM), Voice (V), and Keyboard, Mouse and Voice (KMV)), and workload by varying the number of aircraft being controlled (low, medium and high). Results showed that KM outperformed KMV and V for the low and medium workload levels. However, task performance with KMV was found to degrade the least as workload increased. KMV and KM were found to enable significantly more correct responses to the secondary task which was delivered aurally. Participants reported a preference for the combined modalities (KMV), self-assessing that KMV most reduced their workload. This research suggests that the addition of a speech interface to existing keyboard and mouse modalities, for control of aircraft in a simulation, may help manage cognitive load and may assist in controlling more aircraft under higher workloads.}

Twenty-two participants navigated through a simulated environment while using four different graphics. We employed a novel glance allocation analysis to differentiate information likely gathered with each glace with more granularity. Fixed graphics generally resulted in less visual attention and more time scanning for hazards than animated graphics. Finally, the screen-fixed graphic was preferred by participants over all world-relative graphics, suggesting that graphic spatially integration into the world may not always be necessary in visually complex urban environments like those considered in this study.}

Activity and fatigue of four muscles were measured using surface electromyography (sEMG), these were: anterior deltoid (AD), cervical erector spinae (CES), upper trapezius (UT) and lower trapezius (LT). The intervention condition showed significantly decreased activity of all muscles. Fatigue of all muscles, except LT, significantly increased over time compared to the start point in the control condition. There was no significant difference in muscle fatigue between each time point in the intervention condition. In conclusion, the ergonomic arm support prototype device can be used as ergonomic intervention to reduce neck and shoulder muscle loading and fatigue.}
