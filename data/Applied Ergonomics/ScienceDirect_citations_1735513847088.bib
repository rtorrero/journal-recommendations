abstract = {This study was to examine the kinematics, muscle activities, and perceived physical exertion in different regions of the spine during patient transfers by nursing students between a bed and a wheelchair, with or without a transfer belt in a laboratory setting. Results showed that with the effect of the belt, the % maximum voluntary contraction of the lumbar erector spinae was reduced significantly by nearly 10%. Muscle activity was significantly increased in thoracic erector and multifidus spinae during wheelchair-to-bed transfer, compared to bed-to-wheelchair transfers. There was no significant effect of belt or task on the spinal angular displacement in different spinal regions. Using the transfer belt was associated with a significantly decreased score for perceived exertion. In conclusion, this study supports the use of a transfer belt contributing to lower muscle activity and lower perceived physical exertion in the low back.}

In spite of this, the move towards shared office environments continues; yet there is a lack of research describing open-plan offices that have positive outcomes for workers. We describe a “best practice” open-plan fit-out of a law firm and provide data from occupants relating to their performance, well-being, and collegial relationships. Six months after moving to an open-plan office, staff were anonymously surveyed, and 24 were interviewed. Fourteen months later, occupants responded to a follow-up survey. Positive outcomes relating to aesthetics, collegiality, and communication were achieved through good technical design and thoughtful ergonomic assessment of the needs of employees and the requirements of their tasks. A gender difference emerged whereby female, but not male, workers in this environment reported feeling observed. This has implications for the relatively different impact these environments may have on workers. Thus, by following ergonomic principles to create open-plan offices that are ‘safe by design’ organizations can ameliorate many of the negative consequences associated with these environments.}

Fourteen firefighter-paramedics, working in two-person teams, were instrumented with motion capture and electromyographic sensors. The Binder Lift™, the Simple Strap, and the Slip Preventer were used to lift patient actors, and were compared to current lifting methods. Postural data and the peak dynamic spine shear forces at the L5/S1 level were reduced when using the Simple Strap, the Binder Lift, and the Simulated Inflatable Seat. The Slip Preventer reduced spine flexion when the Binder Lift was not used. In summary, the tested devices can potentially reduce the biomechanical loads experienced by EMS providers as they lift and move patients.}

The climbing tests were performed at five ladder slope and handrail conditions: 30° with low (305 mm) and high (914 mm) handrails, 52.5° with and without a low handrail, and 75° without a handrail. Foot and hand forces and body movements were recorded and used to calculate joint moments of the upper and lower body. Reduced rung spacing resulted in reduced foot forces, reduced hand forces, and reduced ankle transverse moment. It was also associated with increased climbing speed for female climbers, and increased ankle vertical overshoot. The results indicate that reduced rung spacing on aerial ladders may lead to lower biomechanical stress; better climbing efficiency and safety; and reduced climbing speed disparity across sexes.}

abstract = {There is a growing body of studies indicating that extended shift duration has an adverse effect on fatigue, consequently leading to reduced work performance and higher risk of accident. Following modern fatigue risk management systems (FRMS), acceptable performance could be maintained by the mobilization of appropriate mitigation strategies. However, the effective deployment of such strategies assume that workers are able to assess their own level of fatigue-related impairments. In this study, we sought to determine whether emergency physicians’ subjective feelings of sleepiness could provide accurate knowledge of actual fatigue-related impairments while working extended shifts. We conducted a prospective observational study with a within-subjects repeated measures component. We collected sleep logs, sleepiness ratings and reaction times on a Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) at different time points during shifts. Our results show that the PVT is sensitive to sleep loss and fatigue, with a 10% increase in mean reaction time across the shift. Subjective sleepiness, however, showed no significant association with time since awakening and was not a significant predictor of PVT performance. Our results are consistent with experimental studies showing that individuals tend to underestimate fatigue-related impairments when sleep deprived or functioning under adverse circadian phase. The discrepancy between subjective sleepiness and actual fatigue-related impairments may give workers the illusion of being in control and hinder the deployment of mitigation strategies. Further research is needed to determine the relative weight of circadian phase shifting and cumulative sleep deprivation in the decline of self-knowledge in extended shifts.}

The present study examined how members of the diabetic population use features of the home environment to support PHIM. Participants (N = 60) explored a simulated home environment, the VR CAVE, and identified the most useful features for performing three examples of PHIM tasks. The computer was perceived as the most useful feature for PHIM. However, perceived usefulness of features varied based on the PHIM task performed and the rooms in which features appeared. We conclude that a detailed study of the affordances of features is necessary to ease the burden of managing chronic illness, particularly diabetes mellitus, in the sociotechnical system of the home.}

Cue plausibility for false alarms (i.e. how the cued object was similar to a prohibited item) and support system reliability were manipulated at two levels (high/low). Furthermore, half of participants were provided with a rationale about automation failures (RAF) to reduce their negative impact on trust and performance. The results showed lower performance and more compliance with automation suggestions when cues were implausible than plausible. The RAF increased the response time and did not improve detection performance. Overall, this suggests that effective (computer-based) training is needed to reduce the negative effect of plausible cues.}

Human fatigue was noted as a frequent (n = 26) issue in the HF-quality relationship – a finding that warrants closer examination. We extend this review by investigating the relationship between fatigue and manufacturing quality by identifying how fatigue has been conceptualized and measured, and we attempted to quantify their relationship. From the original database, 12 of 26 relevant studies (46%) indicated that physical fatigue was the primary contributor to observed quality deficits. There was a positive relationship between fatigue and quality deficits, with fatigue accounting up to 42% of the variance. More studies are needed to improve the resolution, specificity, and power of these analyses. This study sheds light on the role of HF and human fatigue effects on manufacturing quality with macroergonomic implications for embedding HF aspects into design and quality assurance processes.}

We used a subjective measure of time to fatigue and pain in the neck and shoulder regions as well as objective readings from a surface electromyogram (sEMG). The IMT delayed the sensation of pain in the neck and shoulder region while reducing the overall sEMG muscle activation. In conclusion, IMT is a useful strategy in reducing and delaying the pain in neck and shoulder from prolonged working under the microscope.

abstract = {Last (and First) mile deliveries are an increasingly important and costly component of supply chains especially those that require transport within city centres. With reduction in anticipated manufacturing and delivery timescales, logistics personnel are expected to identify the correct location (accurately) and supply the goods in appropriate condition (safe delivery). Moving towards more environmentally sustainable supply chains, the last/first mile of deliveries may be completed by a cyclist courier which could result in significant reductions in congestion and emissions in cities. In addition, the last metres of an increasing number of deliveries are completed on foot i.e. as a pedestrian. Although research into new technologies to support enhanced navigation capabilities is ongoing, the focus to date has been on technical implementations with limited studies addressing how information is perceived and actioned by a human courier. In the research reported in this paper a comparison study has been conducted with 24 participants evaluating two examples of state-of-the-art navigation aids to support accurate (right time and place) and safe (right condition) navigation. Participants completed 4 navigation tasks, 2 whilst cycling and 2 whilst walking. The navigation devices under investigation were a handheld display presenting a map and instructions and an in-sight monocular display presenting text and arrow instructions. Navigation was conducted in a real-world environment in which eye movements and device interaction were recorded using Tobii-Pro 2 eye tracking glasses. The results indicate that the handheld device provided better support for accurate navigation (right time and place), with longer but less frequent gaze interactions and higher perceived usability. The in-sight display supported improved situation awareness with a greater number of hazards acknowledged. The benefits and drawbacks of each device and use of visual navigation support tools are discussed.}

We encourage the use of the two techniques together to decrease MS.}

Road user impatience and frustration has been identified as an underlying factor in non-compliance and can be characterised as a specific risk factor. However, research on non-compliance related to waiting times and driver inconvenience lacks in the literature. This paper, therefore, seeks to enhance the currently limited understanding of the relationship between waiting times and risky driver behaviour. An Advanced Driving Simulator was used to obtain objective measures of level crossing non-compliance. Subjective measures on driver frustration and decision-making processes were also collected. Sixty participants completed six driving tasks each, with the tasks varying in terms of traffic conditions, number of trains and associated waiting times. This study shows that increased waiting times result in higher levels of frustration and an increased likelihood of risky driving behaviour, particularly for waiting times longer than 3 min. Non-compliance included entering the activated crossing before boom gates are down, entering the crossing after the train passage but before signals are deactivated, stopping/reversing on the crossing. Subjective data revealed that participants did not comply with level crossing rules due to factors including time pressure, impatience/frustration and low perceived risk. The results suggest that, where possible, waiting times should be standardised at values lower than 3 min to reduce the likelihood of risky road user behaviour.}

The purpose of this study is to revise and validate the design of RETIPS. The tool was revised based on feedback of clinicians at a large multi-specialty hospital, resulting in a version customized for anesthesia residents, RETIPS-AnRes. RETIPS-AnRes was administered on a pilot-basis to anesthesia resident groups for a limited period of time. A review of the reports obtained shows a strong alignment of responses with the conceptual basis of the tool, i.e. learning about how things go well in everyday work. The exemplars include both, specific instances of successful patient care, as well as generic routines that contribute to safe and/or effective care delivery. These findings support RETIPS as a tool to operationalize the Safety-II paradigm in healthcare. Lessons and implications for implementation on a wider scale are discussed.}

A driving simulator study was conducted in which 36 drivers were exposed to different levels of urgent and critical situations. They involved the approach of an emergency vehicle, an emergency braking of a lead vehicle, a roadworks area and a congested section of a road. All these events took place in a simulated motorway scenario. In the EEBL event, the vehicle braking ahead with the brake lights on was either visible or not (between-subjects). Whereas no effect of RWW and TCW were observed on driving behaviour, results showed that drivers who were shown the EEBL warnings had shorter braking and decelerating response times, and a slower mean speed during the events, and this was independent of brake lights visibility. The EVW resulted in participants giving way to the emergency vehicle (i.e. staying on the slow lane instead of overtaking slower vehicles) more frequently than those who did not receive the warning. The mobile phone app was accepted and considered usable. Locating the mobile phone in different locations within the drivers' line of sight (i.e. dashboard, instrument cluster) did not impact significantly neither drivers’ attitudes nor behaviour. Additional in-vehicle information systems could enhance safety and allow emergency vehicles to get faster to their destination.}

Effective teamwork is critical to patient safety across multiple healthcare settings. However, current observational tools assessing teamwork performance tend to be developed for specific settings or tasks and do not capture temporal features of interaction. This study aimed to develop a valid and reliable observational teamwork behaviour framework, which is based on healthcare practice, applicable across a variety of healthcare contexts and can be used to capture temporal team dynamics.
Methods
Team interactions were audio-visually recorded during routine simulation training at two large clinical education centres specialising in physical and mental healthcare. The framework was based on theoretical models of teamwork and was developed in three steps: 1-micro analysis of verbal and nonverbal behaviour during recorded scenarios (n = 20); 2-iterative test and refine cycles; 3-final behavioural framework applied to a cohort of acute emergency scenarios (n = 9) by two raters to assess inter-rater agreement.
Results
The framework contains twenty-three specific verbal and nonverbal behaviours that can be identified during observations. Behaviours are grouped conceptually based on their function resulting in thirteen behavioural functions, which cluster into five overarching teamwork domains. Inter-rater agreement was excellent (Cohen's Kappa = .84, SE = 0.03).
Conclusion
We present a valid and reliable behavioural framework, grounded in teamwork theory and empirical observations of clinical team behaviour. This framework enables analysis of the nuances and temporal features of clinical practice in depth and across a wide range of clinical contexts and settings. Use of this framework will advance our understanding of teamworking in healthcare.}

abstract = {Biomechanical overload in the wrist flexor and extensor muscles, together with awkward hand positions during work activities, can result in occupational wrist and hand disorders. Dairy workers, specifically those that work in the milking parlor, are exposed to highly repetitive and forceful exertions of the upper limb throughout their work shift. There are very few studies that have investigated the determinants that contribute to the risk of distal upper limb musculoskeletal disorders among dairy workers. The purpose of the present study was to identify the variables affecting the biomechanical overload of the distal upper limb among milking parlor workers, define risk profiles, and propose possible interventions to reduce the high physical loads to the distal upper limb during milking activities. Forty male workers from the three most common milking parlor systems in Lombardy Italy were recruited to participate in this study. Multiple correspondence analysis of personal characteristics and occupational risk factors, followed by cluster analysis, led to the identification of three distinct groups of workers. Low, medium and high risk profiles were assigned to each group based on the risk assessments performed using the Strain Index and electromyography of the distal upper limb. The main risk determinants were workstation characteristics, work organization and milking routine. A well-organized milking routine, milking cluster weight below 2.4 kg or the use of supporting arms for the milking cluster may reduce the risk of biomechanical overload.}
