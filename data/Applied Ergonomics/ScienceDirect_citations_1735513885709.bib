This persistent disconnect is compounded by unique aspects of healthcare as an institution, industry and work system. Clinically-embedded HFE practitioners, a new HFE sub-specialty, are a conduit for addressing substantive mismatches between the two domains. Greater HFE penetration will require a fundamental change in stance for both domains, however, the burden will lie with HFE to be the more adaptive of the two. Learning more about the in situ work of this sub-specialty will provide insights for more nuanced approaches to bridging domain specific mismatches and obstacles.}

Stair nosings are intended to provide greater foot accommodation, although to date little is known about how the nosing shape can affect foot trajectory during stair ambulation. This study investigates the impact of different nosing shapes (round, square, tapered, and no nosing) on foot clearance and overhang measures during stair ascent and descent among healthy and post-stroke older adults. Slower cadence in ascent and descent, and greater foot overhang during descent highlighted the increased risk of stair falls for persons with chronic stroke. For both healthy and post-stroke participants, the tapered and round nosing shapes resulted in the largest horizontal foot clearance, and smallest foot overhang, respectively. However, given the greater step-to-step variability detected with round nosings, the tapered nosing presents as the safest choice among all evaluated designs. The results of this work can be used to inform architectural and accessible design standards for a safer built environment.}

abstract = {Objective
The railway industry in Indonesia has grown substantially in the past five years, with greater network and tracks length that will double in 2030. There has been a growing concern, however, that fatigue among front-line personnel have not been addressed satisfactorily. This study aimed at evaluating the degree of fatigue among passenger train drivers and suggested practical recommendations to the Indonesian Railway Company.
Method
A total of 32 train drivers (driving for about 4 h during the morning or afternoon shifts) agreed to participate in the study. Subjective and objective measures of fatigue (and sleepiness) were obtained prior to, during, and immediately following the end of a duty. Fatigue and driving performance were also determined based on (off-line) analysis of continuous video recordings of the drivers performing the duty.
Results
Fatigue generally increased as a function of time and, for some, 2 h of driving was sufficient in inducing substantial level of fatigue increase. Unlike the morning shift, the afternoon shift was characterized with increased undue fatigue and unacceptable level of performance decrements.
Conclusion
In general, fatigue was not found among train drivers working the morning shift. For these drivers, however, there were a couple of individuals with excessive levels of fatigue. The effects of fatigue were more apparent for the afternoon shift. This is possibly due to the degraded sleep quality as a result of split rest periods obtained prior to the duty. It is suggested in this study that the company pay a much closer attention to the work-sleep schedules, and to improve sleep quality by redesigning better sleeping arrangements.}

The lexical and manual analysis of the interviews shows that the precursory users' speech is the most valuable in terms of both richness and novelty. The discourse of the experts is also richer and more original than that of the ordinary users and differs from that of the precursory users: professional-based for the experts and experience-based for the precursory users.

The design of these complex socio-technical systems is continuously evolving to accommodate larger populations, and their adaptation is essential in supporting the successful and sustainable development of cities and regions. An essential part of this adaptation includes working to increase passenger safety and to minimise their risk of injury. With this focus, key objectives of the current study were to identify the causes of slip, trip and fall (STF) incidents attributable to the rail user and to train and station characteristics. An investigation of historical STF records of 1247 train and station incidents in two Australian jurisdictions was conducted. Various contributing factors to STF events were identified, including locations such as stairs, ramps, escalators, the train's entry and exit step, doorway areas, and passenger running or rushing. A mixed-method field study was then conducted at three train stations and on trains. To further investigate the contributing factors, participants (N = 40) wore an eye tracker as they navigated the stations and trains. The research illustrates that their continuous search for information, and a disconnect between the information needed and the information provided, might be a cause of passenger distraction and an increase in their risky behaviour. Therefore, we suggest that improvements in information design to reduce the high visual workload for passengers might also reduce the incidence of STFs.}

The aim of this study was to quantify the postural demand, workload, and discomfort experienced by vascular surgeons and to identify procedural factors that influence surgical workload. Both objective (wearable posture sensors) and subjective (surveys) assessment tools were used to evaluate intraoperative workload during 47 vascular surgery procedures. Results demonstrate unfavorable neck and low back postures as well as high pain scores for those body segments. Additionally, workload from subjective surveys increased significantly as a function of operative duration, and mental workload was high across all procedure types. Neck postural risk exposure and physical demand were among the variables that increased with surgical duration, procedure type, and loupes used by the surgeons. Correlations among postural angles and pain scores showed consistency between the objective assessment and the subjective surveys for neck and trunk. The authors believe that the results of this study highlight the need for developing mitigating measures such as ergonomic interventions for vascular surgery.}

The resonance frequency in the fore-and-aft in-line transmissibilities to the seat pan and the backrest decreased with increasing thickness of foam at the seat pan and the backrest.

abstract = {Occupational tasks often involve musculoskeletal demands that contribute to injury risk. In pallet wrapping tasks, 36% of workplace claims involve over exertion and repetitive exposures (Workplace Safety and Prevention Services, 2012). Tools that modify how the wrap is handled by workers have been introduced to help mitigate over exertion and extreme postures wherever possible. A novel device has been introduced that places the required tension on the roll to mitigate these factors. However, the effect of reducing the necessary tension on the roll during pallet wrapping in limiting muscular demand and extreme postures is unknown. Fourteen healthy university aged participants completed 12 wrapping trials on a simulated pallet (2 repetitions of 2 wrapping techniques (device, hand wrapping) at 3 wrapping heights (low, medium, high)). Surface electromyography (sEMG) was measured on 6 shoulder and 2 low back muscles; anterior and middle deltoids, biceps brachii, infraspinatus, supraspinatus, upper trapezius, and erector spinae (T8 & L3). Kinematic data were collected for the torso and upper extremity and global to torso, and torso to upper arm angles were computed. Repeated measures ANOVAs were performed for the following experimental factors: 1) technique used (device or hand wrapping) and 2) the wrapping height (low, medium, high) for each muscle (8), angle (5), rating of perceived discomfort (1) and rating of perceived exertion (1). Pallet wrapping without a device required greater trunk flexion at lower heights and thoracohumeral elevation at higher wrapping heights as compared to using the device. Muscular activation increased when using the device, specifically at the higher and lower heights. Posture and muscular demands during pallet wrapping tasks are sensitive to both wrapping technique and wrapping height. Ergonomics interventions such as this device may mitigate postural risks associated with manual material handling tasks.}

A laboratory experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of each NDRT attribute on the corresponding stage of the process of taking over control. A prediction model was developed using the results of multiple linear regression analysis. Additionally, a validation experiment with nine NDRTs and a baseline condition was conducted to determine the extent to which the developed model explains the takeover time for each NDRT condition. The results showed that the timing aspects of the transition of control in HAD largely consist of participant motor reactions that are affected by the physical attributes of NDRTs.}

Data collected from a series of comparison studies undertaken in a commercial office building suggests that RTLS can measure the velocity at which people are moving and locate them, when stationary, with an accuracy of 0.668 m (SD 0.389). This opens up significant opportunities to further understand how people move within buildings, the indoor physical environmental influences on that movement, and the development of effective interventions to help people to move more whilst at work.}

We characterized balance recovery strategies, trunk and center-of-mass (COM) kinematics, and handrail use following unexpected forward balance loss during stair descent, and the effect of perturbation magnitude on these outcomes. Eighteen young adults experienced a rapid platform translation during stair descent to disrupt balance. Deception was used to reduce anticipation. All participants used compensatory stepping to recover balance, and most applied forces to the handrail in multiple directions. Higher perturbation magnitude resulted in higher COM velocity and handrail forces, more frequent incomplete steps, and quicker step contact time. Our findings provide a foundation for understanding balance recovery on stairs. The findings emphasize the importance of designing stairways that enable compensatory stepping, and handrails that permit adequate force generation in multiple directions to facilitate balance recovery on stairs.}

Participants (n = 63) completed one of three versions of an assembly task (between-subject-design) with LEGO® bricks: (1) with paper instruction (P), (2) with text instructions presented stepwise via digital glasses (GT), (3) with stepwise text and auditory instruction (in parallel) on digital glasses (GA). Outcome measures on performance were completion time and errors. Furthermore, usability was measured by the User Experience Questionnaire, the Standardized Usability Questionnaire, the Post-Study Usability Questionnaire, and cognitive processing skills were assessed by the Trail Making Test and different versions of the Eriksen Flanker Task. Analyses were adjusted for the confounding factors age, gender, experience with glasses and LEGO, and problems with instruction.
Results
Findings indicate that task completion was faster with the paper instructions compared to both versions of instruction via digital glasses (GT, GA). We observed no difference in accuracy and usability between the instructions. “Novelty” was rated higher for instructions for both GT and GA, compared to P.
Discussion
Results show that instructions on digital glasses may not always be more effective for assembly than the traditional paper-based instructions. Further studies are necessary to investigate whether effectiveness may depend on task complexity, target group, experience of the user with task and device, and how the information is presented.}

This cross-sectional study applied state-of-the-art musculoskeletal models driven by kinematic data obtained in two supermarkets to estimate joint reaction forces in the knees, shoulders and lumbar spine under dynamic lifting conditions. Based on 1479 lifts from 15 workers, 8 tasks for which the compression or shear forces in the L5-S1 joint exceeded well-known biomechanical tolerance limits were identified. High shoulder forces were associated with lifting relatively heavy merchandise to high shelves, while the weight of the handled merchandise was the main predictor of high knee forces. The study addressed well-known limitations associated with traditional lifting analysis tools and was the first to present a detailed analysis of the biomechanical loads during manual material handling tasks in the supermarket sector based on field measurements.}

abstract = {Introduction
Military leaders must understand how modern military equipment loads affect trade-offs between movement speed and physiological strain to optimize pacing strategies.
Purpose
To evaluate the effects of load carried in a recently developed military backpack on the walking speed and cardiometabolic responses of dismounted warfighters.
Methods
Fifteen soldiers (1 woman, 14 men; age, 22 ± 2 years; height, 173 ± 7 cm; body mass (BM), 73 ± 10 kg) completed incremental walking tests with four external load conditions (0, 22, 44, or 66% BM) using the US Army's newest backpack: the Modular Lightweight Load-Carrying Equipment 4000 (MOLLE 4000). Oxygen uptake (V̇O2) and heart rate (HR) were evaluated relative to maximal values (V̇O2max and HRmax respectively). Testing ceased when participants completed the highest tested speed (1.97 m s−1), exceeded a respiratory exchange ratio (RER) of 1.00, or reached volitional exhaustion.
Results
Peak speed significantly decreased (p < 0.03) with successively heavier loads (0% BM, 1.95 ± 0.06 m s−1; 22% BM, 1.87 ± 0.10 m s−1; 44% BM, 1.69 ± 0.13 m s−1; 66% BM, 1.48 ± 0.13 m s−1). Peak V̇O2 was significantly lower (p < 0.01) with 0% BM (47 ± 5% V̇O2max) than each load (22% BM, 58 ± 8% V̇O2max; 44% BM, 63 ± 10% V̇O2max; 66% BM, 61 ± 11% V̇O2max). Peak HR was significantly lower (p < 0.01) with 0% BM (71 ± 5% HRmax) versus each load (22% BM, 83 ± 6% HRmax; 44% BM, 87 ± 6% HRmax; 66% BM, 88 ± 6% HRmax).
Conclusion
Overburdened warfighters suffer severe impairments in walking speed even when carrying recently developed military load carriage equipment. Our results suggest that the relative work intensity of heavy load carriage may be better described when expressed relative to HRmax versus V̇O2max.}

The handling of bread and cucumbers to high shelf heights showed the highest trapezius muscle activity (from 47% to 59% peak normalized EMG), while the handling of bananas as well as lifting milk, bread and cucumbers from low to high positions showed the highest erector spinae activity (from 59% to 71%). Twenty-two tasks involved flexing the shoulders and trunk more than 90° and 50°, respectively. Based on these results, several manual handling practices in supermarkets should be reconsidered to reduce the physical work demands.}

An increasing prevalence of cameras in the world, means an increase in screens in the control room. This presents a signal-to-noise challenge where the signal (criminal activity) may become more difficult to detect amongst the noise. We used signal detection approaches to understand which factors were associated with decision-making in a CCTV task. When detecting aggressive incidents, higher conscientiousness was associated with making better decisions, with a higher criterion for responding (meaning fewer false-positive responses). However, conscientious individuals tended to be less confident (in multiplex displays), and were slower in responding – which reflects that these individuals require more evidence to make these decisions. Higher trait cognitive anxiety was again associated with making earlier responses, while extraversion was also associated with earlier responding in multiplexed displays. Taken in combination, our results suggest that there is a fine balance between making correct decisions, and making early decisions – and that these need to be considered together in the CCTV task.}

The interviews were audio-taped, and qualitative content data analysis was carried out continuously and simultaneously with data collection over a 12-month period. 1118 meaning codes were extracted which could be understood though fourteen categories of stressor associated with the five themes of the work system. Employees reported the job was stressful primarily because of organizational structural problems and management attributes, although aspects of living and working on the small island were also difficult. These results provide direction for intervention that can dovetail with risk assessment of occupational health of workers.}

We found that simulated high amplitude self-oscillation (approximately 16 m peak-to-peak) at either 0.25 Hz or 0.5 Hz: 1) generated the strongest effects on postural sway; and 2) made participants feel more spatially present in the virtual environment. Our findings provide insight into the parameters of simulated self-motion that generate the strongest postural responses within virtual environments. These postural constraints have valuable implications for improving our understanding of sensory processes underlying the ergonomic experience of virtual environments simulated using HMDs.}

Safety footwear has been in widespread use across many industries worldwide since the 1970s, and has become an essential part of industrial Personal Protective Equipment. The number of women entering predominantly male industrial environments, and requiring safety footwear is rising, and this is accompanied by anecdotal reports of ill-fitting and uncomfortable footwear. This research proactively compares the opinions of women and men regarding their experience of safety footwear. A systematically designed survey aims to substantiate previously anecdotal knowledge around safety footwear, including key drivers for end-user purchases, wear habits and comfort issues (establishing any differences between women and men). Chi-squared testing was used to assess statistical significance and ensure robustness of findings. The responses and resulting analysis confirmed that comfort and fit were key drivers for all end users; women and men have different wear habits (women wear their safety footwear less frequently and for shorter periods of time than men – likely due to the reported comfort issues); a significant proportion of women (60%) found their safety footwear less comfortable than their regular footwear, however, 45% of men also reported the same, which has not been reported anecdotally. In general, the users of safety footwear accepted a level of discomfort in at least one area of the foot before deeming footwear ‘uncomfortable’. The significant analysis performed on the captured data has, to the authors knowledge, never before been undertaken for this breadth of industry, age and gender with 632 responses received. This makes it the largest study of this field to date.}

We used a mixed factorial design to examine the effects of trust and trust violations on human-human and human-robot interactions over time with an emphasis on anthropomorphic robots in a social context. We found consistent and significant effects of partner behavior. Specifically, partner distrust behaviors led to participants’ lower levels of trustworthiness perceptions, trust intentions, and trust behaviors over time compared to partner trust behaviors. We found no significant effect of partnering with a human versus an anthropomorphic robot over time across the three dependent variables, supporting the computers as social actors (CASA; Nass and Moon, 2000) paradigm. This study demonstrated that there may be instances where the effects of trust violations from an anthropomorphized robot partner are not meaningfully different from those of a human partner in a social context.}

A single-material insole, comprised of polyurethane, had reduced density and compressive stiffness compared to a dual-material insole with added viscoelastic material in rearfoot and forefoot regions. Load carriage increased peak pressure across the foot. Both insoles reduced plantar pressure in the rearfoot. Yet, the softer single-material insole also attenuated forefoot pressure and loaded walking did not appear to cause bottoming-out of the polyurethane. Plantar pressure changes did not affect perceived footwear comfort. The softer single-material insole was more effective in reducing plantar pressure, further research would confirm if this influences injury prevalence.}

A vigilance decrement was demonstrated throughout the sustained visual search task, as evident in increased response latencies and decreased accuracy over time. Further, changes in response latency throughout the sustained visual search task were positively associated with changes in response latency during a 30-min, low signal probability task, a 45-min low signal probability task, and a 45-min high signal probability task. The findings indicate that the sustained visual search task may be a valid alternative to a longer-duration process control task for experimental studies, and is likely to be of value for assessments of the capacity for sustained attention of operators in process control environments.}

Data was collected from focus groups with bus drivers (n = 65 drivers) and one-to-one interviews with bus driver managers (n = 11). Fatigue was seen to be a problem, with all drivers having experienced for themselves the feeling of sleepiness whilst driving the bus, or knowing about it in others. The managers agreed that fatigue amongst drivers is evident, seeing it particularly as a contributor to serious incidents. Fatigue and sleepiness are not discussed between drivers as a general rule and they do not feel comfortable reporting instances of fatigue for fear of being disciplined. Managers would encourage drivers to report these issues and therefore hoped to create a more open culture. Factors identified as contributors to fatigue included: working overtime, having insufficient sleep, spending time with family, other non-work commitments, shift schedules, and work pressure.}

abstract = {Current taxonomies for assessing foot strategies in manual material handling lack exhaustive classification of foot movements and foot positioning. They also fail to consider different instants of the task as checkpoints to relate foot strategies. The goal of the study was first to develop a new taxonomy to assess foot positions and motions considering those limitations. The second goal was to assess reliability and reproducibility using raw agreement percentages, Cohen's kappa, prevalence-adjusted, bias-adjusted kappa and Gwet's AC1. A filmed task consisted of transferring boxes from one pallet to another. Intra- and inter-rater reliability were assessed reviewing 23% and 10%, respectively, of video data. Reproducibility and reliability results are substantial and almost perfect on average. In comparison to similar studies, reproducibility and reliability were considered acceptable.}

abstract = {In order to be able to develop a hammer drill with which the user can work as ergonomically and productively as possible, the relevant influencing factors must be known. In addition to the unknown influence of the drilling direction, there is a lack of understanding of the relations between user forces, human fatigue, and productivity. To analyze these relations, an experiment was carried out with 15 professional users. First, the influence of feed force, drilling direction, and drill bit on the rate of penetration was examined. Taking into account the rate of penetration and human fatigue, it was then investigated which of the three feed forces produces the highest productivity. Furthermore, the lateral forces applied by the participants during the drilling process were analyzed. Based on the study, it was found that the drilling direction (p < .001, r = −0.198) and the drill bit type (p < .041, r = −0.16) have a significant influence on the rate of penetration. Moreover, it was found that the rate of penetration tends to increase with higher feed forces, however, the theoretical cumulative drilling meters decrease when taking user fatigue into account. Finally, the experiment showed that the participating professionals applied lateral forces (Mdn = 16.7 N) of 13% to the feed force when working with a hammer drill. On the basis of this knowledge, investigations can be done to analyze the influences of lateral forces on the drilling process. The findings help drill and hammer drill manufacturers in testing and development processes. For craftsmen, on the other hand, the knowledge helps to perform the task as ergonomically and time-efficiently as possible.}

Following a sequential exploratory design, an initial questionnaire was completed by 97 Australian female soldiers. Subsequently, 33 Australian female soldiers participated in one of three focus groups. Descriptive statistics of questionnaire data considered alongside thematic analysis of focus group transcripts revealed problems with the design (fit, form and function) of current ADF-issue body armour, as well as problems with the issuance and education surrounding use of the system. It is recommended that anthropometric data of female soldiers be better incorporated into future body armour designs, that these data inform processes surrounding both acquisition and issuance of body armour and that training protocols for body armour use be reviewed.}

This study uses STPA to assess risks in the sepsis treatment process, discusses the potential value STPA adds and compares the results of STPA with the results of another study that used FRAM. The findings indicate that STPA and FRAM have different strengths which reflect the different scientific approaches behind these two methods. FRAM facilitates an in-depth understanding of a system, while STPA allows for more comprehensive risk analysis by identifying more risks, scenarios and safety recommendations. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to say that not only does STPA provide more comprehensive risk analysis; its terminology and philosophy are also closer to the current safety management applications employed in complex systems.}

To analyze progression of changes in kinematics and work physiology during progressive lifting in healthy adults.
Methods
Healthy participants were recruited. A standardized lifting test from the WorkWell Functional Capacity Evaluation (FCE) was administered, with five progressive lifting low series of five repetitions. The criteria of the WorkWell observation protocol were studied: changes in muscle use (EMG), heart rate (heart rate monitor), base of support, posture and movement pattern (motion capture system). Repeated measures ANOVA's were used to analyze changes during progressive workloads.
Results
18 healthy young adults participated (8 men, 10 women; mean age 22 years). Mean maximum weight lifted was 66 (±3.2) and 44 (±7.4) kg for men and women, respectively. With progressive loads, statistically significant (p < 0.01) differences were observed: increase in secondary muscle use at moderate lifting, increase of heart rate, increase of base of support and movement pattern changes were observed; differences in posture were not significant.
Conclusions
Changes in 4 out of 5 kinematic and work physiology parameters were objectively quantified using lab technology during progressive lifting in healthy adults. These changes appear in line with existing observation criteria.}

However, the facial features of social robots and their potential effect on anthropomorphic trustworthiness are seldom analyzed and discussed comprehensively. This study examined whether the trustworthiness perception toward a social robot shared similarity with baby schema features on the human face. It also explored the effects of different combinations of baby schema facial features, especially the positions and sizes of the eyes and mouth, on facial anthropomorphic trustworthiness. A 5-way mixed experiment (N = 270) was conducted accordingly. The results indicated that people would experience a high level of facial anthropomorphic trustworthiness toward robots with baby schema features (i.e., large eyes, with medium vertical and horizontal positions of the eyes and mouth). This paper contributes to the literature on facial anthropomorphic trustworthiness in human-robot interaction and provides suggestions for social robot design.}

In a first experiment, mental arithmetic tasks were used to induce different levels of cognitive activity. In a second experiment, influences of screen polarity and presentation of information were investigated (N = 18).

A multi-phase, multi-sited and mixed methods design was utilized, in which, Phase 1 included collecting semi-structured interviews and focus group data, and Phase 2 consisted of six patient/caregiver dyad prospective case studies. This study was conducted in three hospitals in three cities in a single province in Canada. The Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM) was employed to model daily operations of the transition process. The perspectives of both healthcare providers and patients/caregivers were used to build the FRAM model. The transition model was then tested using a customized version of the FRAM. The six patient/caregiver cases were used in the process of testing the FRAM model. The results of building the FRAM model showed that five categories of functions contributed to the transition model, including admission, assessment, synthesis, decision-making, and readmission. The outcomes of using the customized version of the FRAM revealed challenges affecting the transition process including waitlists for geriatric units, team-based care, lack of a discharge planner, financial concerns, and follow-up plans. The findings of this study could assist managers and other decision makers to improve the transition processes of frail older adults by addressing these challenges. The FRAM method employed in this study can be applied widely to identify work practices that are more or less successful, so that procedures and practices can be adapted to nudge healthcare processes towards paths that will yield better outcomes.}

For this purpose, the postures of 20 volunteers have been observed by 3 varying human raters in a laboratory setting and the inter-rater agreement against reference values was determined. A high agreement of over 98% (κ=0.98) was found for the postures of the arms but lower agreements were found for posture classification of the legs (66−97%,κ=0.85) and the upper body (80−96%,κ=0.85). No significant difference was found between raters with and without intense prior training in physical therapy. Consequently, the results confirm the general reliability of the OWAS method especially for raters with non-specialized background but suggests weaknesses in the reliable detection of a few particular postures.}

With this as a consideration comes the desire to accurately measure, track and even predict MS state in real-time. Previous research has considered physiological measurements to measure MS state, although, this is mainly measured after an MS exposure and not throughout exposure(s) to a MS task. A unique contribution of this paper is in the real-time tracking of subjective MS alongside real-time physiological measurements of Electrodermal Activity (EDA) and skin temperature. Data was collected in both simulator-based (controlled) and on-road (naturalistic) studies. 40 participants provided at total of 61 data sets, providing 1603 min of motion sickness data for analysis. This study is in agreement that these measures are related to MS but evidenced a total lack of reliability for these measures at an individual level for both simulator and on-road experimentation. It is likely that other factors, such as environment and emotional state are more impactful on these physiological measures than MS itself. At a cohort level, the applicability of physiological measures is not considered useful for measuring MS accurately or reliably in real-time. Recommendations for further research include a mixed-measures approach to capture other data types (such as subject activity) and to remove contamination of physiological measures from environmental changes.}

abstract = {Objective
We examined the impact of increasing cognitive load on climbing performance and the impact of climbing on concurrent cognitive task performance.
Background
Generally when two tasks are performed simultaneously performance of one or both suffers relative to performance of each alone. Such dual task decrement is not confined to competing cognitive tasks, but has also been found when one task involves demanding physical activity.
Method
Skilled climbers performed a traverse climb alone and in combination with low and high cognitive load counting tasks, which were also performed alone.
Results
In more realistic physical settings, physical and cognitive tasks will interfere, unlike what some literature using laboratory physical tasks may indicate.
Conclusion
Compared to single task (climb only) performance concurrent counting and climbing resulted in impaired performance. However, climbers appeared to prioritize climbing over cognitive task performance.
Application
The results and this program of research have implications for occupations that involve concurrent demanding physical activity and cognitive task performance.
Précis
High risk, physical tasks in real world conditions appear to hinder cognitive performance more so than low-risk physical tasks carried out in laboratory conditions.}

abstract = {Objectives
This systematic review and meta-analysis determined the effects of using an exoskeleton during occupational tasks on physical stress and strain compared to not using an exoskeleton.
Methods
Systematic electronic database searches were performed and the review was prepared according to the PRISMA guidelines. Treatment effects on the predefined outcomes were calculated using standardized mean differences for continuous outcomes in several meta-analyses using Review Manager 5.3. Registration: PROSPERO (CRD42020168701).
Results
63 articles were included in qualitative syntheses and 52 in quantitative, but most of them did not extensively evaluate musculoskeletal stress and strain and the risk of bias was rated high for all included studies. Statistically significant effects of using back, upper-limb, or lower-limb exoskeletons have been observed in the supported body areas (e.g. reduced muscle activity, joint moments and perceived strain). Studies which did not exclusively focus on the supported body area also showed statistically significant effects in the non-supported areas (e.g. changed muscle activity and perceived strain) and in physiological outcomes (e.g. reduced energy expenditure).
Conclusions
Using an exoskeleton during occupational tasks seems to reduce user's acute physical stress and strain in the exoskeleton's target area. However, impact on workers' health is still unknown, primarily because of missing long-term evaluations under real working conditions. Furthermore, this systematic review highlights a lack of studies (1) following high quality methodological criteria, (2) evaluating various inter-related stress and strain parameters instead of only focusing on one specific, and (3) evaluating non-target body areas instead of only the directly supported body area.}

Training instructors utilize a variety of methods to ensure military and law enforcement personnel do not inflict unintended casualties. However, there is little empirical evidence about the best methods to design a shooting simulation that might evoke these errors, which is critical to ensure the validity of any assessment or training exercise. The current study analyzed performance across a variety of simulated shooting scenarios developed and applied for military training purposes. Several factors were assessed based upon either the scenario or human performance. Scenario type, number of shots fired, and the ratio of hostiles-to-non-hostiles were significant predictors for the likelihood of inflicting an unintended casualty. This collected evidence should help improve scenario design for future training simulations that will help avoid these critical shooting errors.}

The mismatch percentages were defined as the number of participants whose maximal wrist U/R torque strength were lower than the minimum required torque strength for opening the vacuum-sealed jars. Minimum required torque strength for opening the existing 65 mm and 85 mm vacuum-sealed jars were 4.1 Nm and 6.6 Nm, respectively (range = 4.1 Nm to 10.2 Nm). A considerable mismatch (range = 25%–100%) was found between the required torque strength for opening the existing jars and the wrist U/R torque strength of the study population, particularly for females and those aged 5–9 years. A torque limit of 1.8 Nm was proposed for opening jars for the entire population.}

The aim of this study was to apply a systems ergonomics framework to redesign a current Para sport system via a multi staged approach. The Cognitive Work Analysis framework was used to model and redesign the Para sport system, via the insertion of design interventions. The findings offer insights into the complexity of the Para sport system via the multiple interacting factors that influence the performance of the system. In addition, the design interventions had substantial influence on the Para sport system by creating multiple new processes, functions, measures, and purposes, and enhanced multiple components of the existing system. This study provides a unique contribution to ergonomic science and extends system ergonomics theory and methods in sport. This study has practical implications for policy development by providing a template that can be used by others wanting to optimise able-bodied sport, Para sport, and non-sport systems.}

abstract = {Introduction
Failure-to-identify hunting incidents occur when a hunter, believing they are shooting at an animal, shoots at another human. Anecdotal evidence from the hunting community suggests that heightened arousal or excitement (“buck fever”), liquid intake, food intake, sleepiness and personality factors may be contributory factors to such incidents. Hunters who have shot other people based on failures-to-identify also report observing their hunted quarry for a considerable time before discharging their firearm. Concerning the complexity of hunting, we sought to ascertain if simulation would prove an effective platform for future safety research into this phenomenon.
Method
We conducted a video-based simulation of a deer hunt during a hunting exhibition show. Participants (N = 60) took part in one of four conditions – two types of scenario (having a good versus bad hunt) and two types of video (clear opportunity to shoot a stag versus clear opportunity to shoot an animal that cannot be identified). We investigated hunting outcomes and physiological arousal during the simulation, as well as personality traits, and self-reports of food, liquid intake and sleepiness. We also measured estimated versus actual time elapsed.
Results
Pupil dilation, consistent with psychophysiological arousal, occurred when the hunter spotted their first stag, whereas Electrodermal Activity reduced. In the 10 s before shooting, EDA increased substantially. Time also appeared to slow down based on the participants’ estimations of duration.
Conclusions
The findings corroborate suggestions of physiological arousal in the immediate lead-up to shooting but fall short of direct evidence for “buck fever” contributing to target misidentification. The simulation appeared to provide enough immersion to facilitate future research.
Practical application
This helps to understand the psychophysiological and temporal considerations of a hunter as they decide to shoot based on the information available to them at the time.}

Thirty-nine participants (23M/16F) performed a bounding rush task consisting of four bounding rush cycles. The sacrum mounted IMU recorded angular velocity and acceleration data were used to provide estimates of sacral velocity and position. Individual rush cycles were parsed into three principal movement phases; namely, the get up, sprint, and get down phases. The timing of each phase was analyzed, averaged for each participant, and compared to the overall rush cycle time using regression analysis. A cluster analysis further reveals differences between high and low performers. Get down time was most predictive of bounding rush performance (R2 = 0.75) followed by get up time (R2 = 0.58) and sprint time (R2 = 0.40). Comparing high and low performers, the get down time exhibited nearly twice the effect on mean rush cycle time compared to get up time (effect size of −2.61 to −1.46, respectively). Overall, this IMU-based method reveals key features of the bounding rush that govern performance. Consequently, this objective method may support future training regimens and performance standards for military recruits, and parallel applications for athletes.}

Perceived productivity decreased significantly after relocation compared to the control group and these effects persisted 12 months after the relocation.

Classification performance using single IMUs placed on several body parts was compared with performance using multiple IMU configurations (2, 3, and 17 IMUs). Overall, the use of a single sensor led to satisfactory results (e.g., median accuracy >97%) in classifying MMH tasks and estimating task duration and frequency. Limited benefits were obtained using additional sensors, and several sensor locations yielded similar outcomes. Classification performance, though, was relatively inferior for push/pull vs. other tasks.}

Twenty professional caregivers (17 females and 3 males) performed a series of simulated patient transfer tasks between a wheelchair and a bed with three different patient transfer methods including the squat pivot, stand pivot, and scoot with two directions (wheelchair to bed and vice versa). The passive exoskeletons (FLx ErgoSkeleton, V22 ErgoSkeleton, and Laevo V2.5) significantly affected trunk postures (forward flexion and lateral flexion), shoulder postures (flexion and abduction), hand pull forces, muscle activities of erector spinae and middle deltoid (p-values < 0.01). The muscle activities of the erector spinae were significantly lower (up to 11.2%) with the FLx and V22 ErgoSkeletons compared to no exoskeleton condition (p-values < 0.002). However, the trunk and shoulder flexion angles with the passive exoskeleton use were greater (up to 77.3%) than those without the exoskeletons (p-values < 0.03). The biomechanical benefits and usability varied by passive exoskeleton designs (p-values < 0.01). The lower muscle activities of the erector spinae suggest that the back-support exoskeletons may be a viable intervention to reduce the low back strain during patient transfer tasks. More research would be needed to reduce the adverse effects of back-support exoskeletons on the postures such as increased trunk and shoulder flexions during patient handling.}

Combined with arm mass increases, shoulder and elbow moment requirements at the minimum and maximum static reach distances significantly increased. However, inverse dynamics analysis determined that mass gains in the arm alone only minimally impact dynamic shoulder moments. Additionally, torso flexion increases throughout pregnancy demonstrates that women are attempting to compensate for decreased SPARS, possibly indicating the additional perceptual importance of reach space in accommodations for pregnant workers.}

abstract = {Purpose
To investigate the influence of aerobic capacity, muscle strength, and body composition on performance and metabolic demands of men wearing personal protective equipment (PPE).
Methods
45 men were assigned to one of four groups which significantly differed in upright pull isometric strength (MVC ≤ 1325 N or ≥ 1531 N) and maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max ≤ 51.9 mL min−1·kg−1 or ≥ 56.0 mL min−1·kg−1): endurance-trained (low MVC, high VO2max), strength-trained (high MVC, low VO2max), endurance- and strength-trained (high MVC, high VO2max), and untrained (low MVC, low VO2max). Each participant underwent two test series consisting of a repeated 10 m dummy drag and a graded exercise test wearing either sportswear or PPE of a German riot police unit weighing 20.9 kg (statistics: two-way repeated measures ANOVA, stepwise multiple linear regressions).
Results
With PPE, dummy drag and running performance were impaired by 14 ± 9% and 58 ± 7%. Groups with high MVC dragged the dummy significantly faster than groups with low MVC (17.5 ± 1.8 s/17.6 ± 1.4 s vs. 23.4 ± 5.6 s/22.3 ± 3.5 s). Running distance was significantly higher in groups with high VO2max (4.5 ± 0.8 km/4.4 ± 0.7 km vs. 3.1 ± 0.5 km/2.8 ± 0.5 km). Body composition variables partially correlated with performance (R ranging from −0.70 to 0.41), but were not significant predictors of the regression models in PPE.
Conclusions
Individuals who showed a certain degree of aerobic endurance, as well as muscle strength, performed consistently well during the test series. Therefore, none of these variables should be trained in isolation but optimized in combination to be capable in a variety of operational tasks.}

Video review was conducted to identify the types of grip postures children aged 3–5 years utilized when attempting to open continuous thread polypropylene vials outfitted with push and turn, child-resistant closures and compared with grip postures identified with the adults. Children tended to utilize only 3 grip postures (spherical, cylindrical, and pronated cylindrical grips), while adults utilized seven different postures. If children utilize a more limited set of grip postures when opening child resistant closures than their adult counterparts, this difference could be exploited when designing child resistant packaging systems. That said, our study utilized a limited number of CRC designs and confounds existed between the package sizes the children in the archived video footage attempted to open and those that served as the point of comparison which identified grip postures utilized by adults. As such, further investigation is needed across a range of package diameters. Potential implications for child-resistant packaging design are discussed.}

The findings demonstrate that all three methods appear to provide useful results in a context other than safety, and that multiple risks threatening the performance of the cycling team were identified. Whilst the frequency and types of risks differed across the methods applied, there are additional theoretical, methodological, and practical implications to be considered prior to the selection and use of systems thinking-based RA approaches.

Multilevel linear regression analysis was used to predict end of shift fatigue based on work demand variables. The best fit model included multiple variables from organizational data sources and a physical activity variable measured by a wearable sensor.

Thirty-eight drivers were selected to participate in this study based on their chronotype. They were divided into morning-type and evening-type groups by their score on the reduced Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (rMEQ). Both groups completed a visual search task and a simulated driving task in a morning session and an evening session. The results showed that morningness-eveningness preferences had synchronous effects on basic driving performance; specifically, morning-type drivers showed better driving behaviour in the morning than in the evening, and evening-type drivers showed the opposite trend. Furthermore, visual search abilities showed a mediating effect between morningness-eveningness preference and driving performance. The mechanisms underlying these results are discussed. Related results and data could aid with schedule arrangements for professional drivers.}

Strategies for preventing CTS in the workplace include interventions such as ergonomics, education, exercise, physical therapy, and occupational health. The purpose of this study was to provide a general overview based on the review of scientific literature regarding strategies used for preventing CTS in working populations. From September to October 2018, the MEDLINE, PUBMED, EMBASE and SCOPUS (1990 to December 2017) databases were searched for evidence. The risk of bias assessment in the selected papers was evaluated using the criteria recommended by The Cochrane Handbook and the methodological quality of the included studies was evaluated using Standard Quality Assessment Criteria for Evaluating Primary Research Papers from a Variety of Fields. A total of 11 studies were included in the present review. A total of 1,061 subjects participated in the studies. The quality of the included studies was limited in three studies, appropriate in three studies, good in three studies, and strong in two studies. The overall results suggest a mixed level of evidence of the effect of applying strategies for preventing CTS in the workplace. The bias assessment was primarily due to incomplete result data, selective reporting of results, and blinding. In this review, interventions focused on the modification or change of accessories (keyboard, mouse, wrist rest, and the overall workstation), education in ergonomics, exercise, and physical therapies, among others, were analyzed. The findings of this review show different possibilities when choosing an intervention strategy for the workplace. However, it was challenging to analyze each of the papers owing to the heterogeneity of the studies included.}

abstract = {Instantaneous consumption displays (ICDs) can be used as central information source to perceive the energy efficiency of manoeuvre-level driving. A key question is whether drivers who use ICDs can accurately derive energy efficiency differences of different driving strategies based on ICDs. There is reason to assume that drivers' consumption judgements may be biased, similar to driving-related phenomena like the time-saving bias. Therefore, the aim of the present research was to examine drivers’ accuracy in deriving average consumption from dynamic ICD sequences. Participants viewed videos of a schematic ICD in a controlled experiment where the maximum instantaneous consumption systematically varied over time. Participants (N = 55) overestimated the average consumption values. The empirical ranking of the sequences did significantly correlate with the heuristic but not with the correct efficiency ranking. The current study incorporated multilevel modelling due to the nested structure of the data. The estimation difference was greater with higher peak height and shorter peak duration. The effect of peak height on estimation difference weakened with longer peak duration. In sum, the results indicate that ICDs can create biased perceptions of energy efficiency and that drivers seem to use simplifying heuristics. Knowledge and affinity for technology interaction appear to relate to biased estimations, whereas the intensity of prior experience with consumption displays seems irrelevant. Further studies should test other interfaces with debiasing potential such as manoeuvre-based aggregation or fading-trace approaches. Moreover, studies are needed that enable modelling of the effects of more natural temporal-spatial visual attention distribution (e.g. in a driving simulator setting).}

Virtual ship motion at Degree 5 induced significant cybersickness with symptom profile: nausea syndrome > central (headache and dizziness) > peripheral (cold sweating) > increased salivation. During a single session of virtual ship motion exposure, GVS aggravated balance disturbance but did not affect most cybersickness symptoms except cold sweating. Repeated exposure induced cybersickness habituation which was delayed by GVS, while the temporal change of balance disturbance was unaffected. These results suggested that vestibular inputs play different roles in cybersickness and balance disturbance during virtual reality exposure. GVS might not serve as a potential countermeasure against cybersickness induced by virtual ship motion.}

Little measurable difference was found in interaction performance, perceived usability and workload between sitting and standing postures. There were significant interaction effects between posture and interaction distance on perceived workload.

To investigate the effect of a task rotation schedule on musculoskeletal injury and the challenges of implementing a task rotation schedule within an underground coal mine.

Results
There were no significant differences in musculoskeletal discomfort between the two sites in any body region. Tasks were rotated two to three times a shift on average.
Conclusions
The task rotation schedule did not have a significant impact upon musculoskeletal discomfort although this does not necessarily reflect that the rotation schedule was in-effective in curbing injury, rather highlights the complexity of developing a successful task rotation schedule within an underground coal mine. The task rotation schedule, its implementation and execution need consideration and further investigation to assist in effectively controlling injury and fatigue risk.}

This study explores one area of healthcare, community pharmacy, and more specifically the task of dispensing medicines from prescriptions, to identify the gap between how dispensing is imagined to be completed through standardised operating procedures, and how it is actually completed in practice, by using Hierarchical Task Analysis as a framework. Document analysis of standardised operating procedures in 3 community pharmacies was used to produce 3 task analyses, which were compared with 3 task analyses produced from data collected through non-participant observations of the same 3 community pharmacies. Deviations between the two forms of task analyses were presented to community pharmacists in focus group discussions and it was found staff may deviate from standardised protocols because of various reasons, including: efficiency; availability of resources; thoroughness; and delegating safeguards. Potential implications for the work system include the benefit of greater collaboration between procedure writers and frontline workers, and the introduction of more flexible procedures, that allow the risks of any adaptions to be clearly realised. Further work must establish whether pharmacists recognise the safety implications of these gaps between work as imagined, and work as done, and initiatives should be established to ensure patient safety is not compromised due to these differences.}

To assess the effects of driving decisions on acceptance, an online experimental study was conducted in China, Germany, Japan and the US. Four overtaking scenarios, in which the automated vehicle took a decision, were presented as short texts. The situations differed with regard to the action (overtaking vs. stay in lane) and potential consequence (high or low hindrance of another driver). Participants then rated their acceptance. The results indicate that acceptance is dependent on the driving decisions and is further influenced by cultural background. Chinese drivers show high acceptance to the decisions and there were no significant differences between the presented scenarios. In the US and Germany, decisions leading to high hindrance of others are rejected, whereas in cases of low hindrance, overtaking is preferred. Japanese participants reject decisions, which lead to hindrance of others.}

abstract = {Patient handling related musculoskeletal injuries are prevalent among Emergency Medical Service (EMS) providers. The first step in many patient handling situations is where a supine patient on the floor is brought to a sitting position. This study investigated whether a strap, placed under the patient's torso and long enough that EMS providers can perform the patient raising task in a standing posture, reduced muscular effort. Fifteen participants raised a simulated patient, with the help of an assistant, using the strap method and a traditional method (grasping the shoulders) in an open area, a restricted space, and in a bathtub. Torso postures improved in all location conditions when using the strap. The muscle activation data showed mixed results. While EMG responses from the latissimus dorsi muscles were reduced, EMG activity of the erector spinae muscles increased when the strap was used. Perceived effort assessments supported the use of the strap.}

The Web of Science, PubMed and CINAHL databases were searched, a total of 1239 records were screened and 20 papers were included in the review. Participant, load and task characteristics and a summary of key findings were extracted. Due to heterogeneity in the reviewed studies, analysis was restricted to qualitative synthesis. There were limited effects on spatio-temporal variables but consistently reported increased trunk, hip and knee flexion and increased hip and knee extension moments. Muscle activation of lower limb and trunk muscles were also increased with loads. However, there were some conflicting findings for most parameters reviewed and apart from spatio-temporal parameters the findings of this review were in line with previous reviews of combined military and civilian populations.}

Such eyes-engaged interactive techniques may significantly degrade the interaction efficiency and user experience, particularly when users have to turn their head frequently to search for a target object in the limited field of view (FOV) of a head-mounted display (HMD). In this study, we systematically investigated user capabilities in eyes-free spatial target acquisition considering different horizontal angles, vertical angles, distances from the user's body, and body sides. Our results show that high acquisition accuracy and low task load are achieved for target locations at front and middle horizontal angles as well as those at middle vertical angles. Meanwhile, a trade-off cannot be achieved between the acquisition accuracy and the task load for target locations at long distances from the user's body. In addition, the acquisition accuracy and task load for the target locations vary with the body side. Our research findings can provide a deeper understanding of user capability in eyes-free target acquisition and offer concrete design guidelines for appropriate target arrangement for eyes-free target acquisition in immersive VR environments.}

abstract = {Fatigue is a critically important aspect of crew endurance in submarine operations, with continuously high fatigue being associated with increased risk of human error and long-term negative health ramifications. Submarines pose several unique challenges to fatigue mitigation, including requirements for continuous manning for long durations, a lack of access to critical environmental zeitgebers (stimuli pertinent to circadian physiology; e.g., natural sunlight), and work, rest and sleep occurring within an encapsulated environment. In this paper, we examine the factors that underlie fatigue in such a context with the aim of evaluating the predictive utility of a biomathematical model (BMM) of fatigue. Three experience sampling studies were conducted with submarine crews using a participant-led measurement protocol that included assessments of subjective sleepiness, workload (NASA-Task Load Index [TLX] and a bespoke underload-overload scale), and sleep. As expected, results indicated that predicting KSS with a BMM approach outperformed more conventional linear modelling approaches (e.g., time-of-day, sleep duration, time awake). Both the homeostatic and circadian components of the BMM were significantly associated with KSS and used as controls in the workload models. We found increased NASA-TLX workload was significantly associated with increased average KSS ratings at the between-person level. However, counter to expectations, the two workload measures were not found to have significant linear or quadratic relationship with fatigue at the within-person level. An important outcome of the research is that applied fatigue researchers should be extremely cautious applying conventional linear predictors when predicting fatigue. Practical implications for the submarine and related extreme work context are discussed. Important avenues for continued research are outlined, including directly estimating BMM parameters.}

Three methods of slide sheet use and a baseline method (no slide sheet) were compared, to reposition a 70 kg individual. Muscle activity, ground reaction force, posture, and rating of perceived exertion were significantly affected by task method. Erector Spinae activity was reduced in boosting and turning away tasks with the slide sheet. Shoulder elevation, torso angle, and normalized vertical ground reaction force were also reduced with the slide sheet during boosting. The turn towards task was generally not improved with the slide sheet. Overall, using a slide sheet provided biomechanical benefits to individual caregivers performing two common patient handling tasks: boosting and turning patient away from caregiver.}

The 58 reported answers pointed out that most of the information, specifically associated with POD, are routinely recorded but not used to stratify the patients' individual risk to develop POD. The results suggest the need for design a new socio-technical role within modern health care systems: the POD analyst. A Systems-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes (STAMP) model is proposed both to propel the awareness about POD and as a template for future POD risk factors collections.}

Therefore, this paper attempts to establish guidance for exploring eye tracking applications in design concept validations through two case studies. The first case study investigated the product attributes based on the theory of cognitive-affective emotions. The second investigated the product attributes for apparent functionality and affective quality. The eye movements of 105 participants were analyzed when they evaluated the products images. The results indicated that product attributes perceived in evaluation tasks can be predicted from eye movements. Moreover, compared to the new users, experienced users had a longer mean fixation duration and tended to form their impressions of the product from multiple components.}

Center of pressure (COP)-based postural sway measures significantly increased following multi-axial WBV exposure. Increase in COP velocity and displacement following multi-axial WBV was significantly higher than the increase in all the other exposure conditions. However, no significant differences between the WBV conditions were observed in functional limits of stability and anticipatory postural adjustments. While our results show standing balance to be impaired following the multi-axial WBV exposure of off-road mining vehicles, dynamic stability across a broader range of conditions needs to be understood to causally link postural stability decrements to increased fall-risks associated with off-road vehicle operators.}

To do this, we conducted a scoping review through a systematic electronic search of seven scientific databases and the websites of ergonomics and occupational health and safety organizations. After screening by independent reviewers according to specific criteria sets, we performed qualitative analyses on the 16 studies retained. Findings revealed six categories of transformation targets sought by the interventions/recommendations with the technical devices/physical work environment category being the most reported. We also found it was quite rare for studies to consider the seasonal work context in and of itself when developing and implementing interventions. Our review thus highlights the need to pay attention to intervention processes in order to better understand the influence of seasonality on the measures taken to prevent MSDs in working environments.}

Kinematics and kinetics of 17 handlers were recorded during a box transfer task between two pallets. Four-way repeated measures ANOVA were conducted on four lift-deposit height conditions (from lift and deposit of 0.16 or 1.16 m), three distances between pallets (1.5, 1.0 and 0.5 m), two handled masses (10 and 20 kg) and two paces (free and faster). The interaction between distance and height on back loading and posture (P < 0.001) showed that increasing distance to more than 1 m is not recommended to avoid unnecessary cumulative loading. The shorter distance of 0.5 m, which generally reduced the most spine loading, may increase it for transfers varying in height. The effect of pace to reduce spine cumulative loading and increase the peak asymmetric loading (P < 0.05) was accentuated by mass, height and distance. The combined factors revealed the importance of tradeoff between peak, cumulative and asymmetric loading.}

The present lab-based study empirically assessed whether the NSIC's human factors design translates into improved user-performance in the determination of insulin doses, compared with a pre-existing chart. Forty-one experienced nurses and 48 novice chart-users completed 60 experimental trials (30 per chart), in which they determined doses to administer to patients. Both groups determined insulin doses faster, and made fewer dose errors, when using the NSIC. These results support the utility of the usability heuristics employed in developing the chart.}

This study aims to investigate the effects of taillight shape on vehicle conspicuity, and proposes ergonomic taillight shape solutions to vehicle designers and manufacturers. Two complementary experiments were conducted to examine three types of taillight shapes at three design levels. The first experiment was designed to investigate the detection speed of a driver and the fixation duration and fixation counts on leading vehicles with different taillight shapes, based on an eye-tracking methodology. The second experiment was designed to investigate the dynamic visual searching performance of a trailing driver for leading vehicles with different taillight shapes, based on a visual search task. The experimental results indicated that a long line-shaped taillight (striplight) was the optimal ergonomic solution for enhancing vehicle conspicuity. Vehicles with an enclosed contour-shaped taillight were more salient than those with an open contour-shaped taillight. Moreover, the experience and gender of the driver and the vehicle–observer distance were found to be closely related to vehicle conspicuity, and therefore, must be considered by vehicle designers when applying a specific taillight shape design. This study provides insights into the taillight shape design that not only aid vehicle designers or manufacturers in enhancing vehicle safety but also enable potential vehicle buyers to choose a safe lighting system.}
