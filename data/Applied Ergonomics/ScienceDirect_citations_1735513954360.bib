abstract = {This study explored the possibility of applying personalized takeover requests (TORs) in an automated driving system (ADS), which required drivers to regain control when the system reached its limits. A driving simulator experiment was conducted to investigate how speech-based TOR voices impacted driver performance in takeover scenarios with two lead time conditions in conditionally automated driving (level 3). Eighteen participants drove in three sessions, with each session having a different TOR voice (a synthesized male voice, a synthesized female voice, and a significant other voice). Two scenarios with a lead time of 5 s and two scenarios with a lead time of 12 s were provided per session. The driver takeover time and quality data were collected. A follow-up interview was conducted to gain a clearer understanding of the drivers’ psychological feelings about each TOR voice during takeovers. Changes in takeover time and takeover quality caused by TOR voices were similar in both lead time conditions, except for the lateral acceleration. The synthesized male voice led to a larger maximum lateral acceleration than the other two voices in the 5 s condition. Interestingly, most drivers preferred choosing the synthesized female voice for future takeovers and showed negative attitudes toward the significant other voice. Our results implied that choosing TOR voices should consider the drivers’ daily voice-usage habits as well as specific context of use, and personalized TOR voices should be incorporated into the ADS prudently.}

Research in this area has led to a diversity of ideas regarding potential activation methods.

Within the current paper, we review available methods of aid activation and describe a process for developing and validating adaptive aiding systems. We focus on supporting system designers who wish to select the ideal aid activation method for an intended application. The process that we recommend is an empirical approach to evaluate the feasibility, costs, and benefits of various potential methods of aid activation. This methodological framework will support practitioners making critical decisions about the design of aiding systems.}

However, research on effective training of UAV pilots has not kept pace with the demand. How much autonomy should be onboard, how much training, and how much control humans should have are still points of debate. To help fill this gap, this paper examines how different training programs and levels of control autonomy affect training outcomes for people operating a UAV in inspection tasks with high onboard autonomy. Results revealed a cost-benefit trade space in that those top performers with both lower-level teleoperation and higher-level supervisory control training could achieve the best performance, but with higher variability, as compare to those who received just supervisory control training. Another important finding was that those trainees who were overconfident were more likely to spend too much time micro-controlling the UAV, and also 15 times more likely to crash. Given that commercial UAV licensing is expected to significantly increase in the next few years, these results suggest more work is needed to determine how to mitigate overconfidence bias both through training and design.}

Fourteen male participants were asked to perform a simulated overhead task of fastening/unfastening nut in 4 randomized sessions, characterized by two variables: neck extension angle (40% and 80% of neck maximum range of motion) and exoskeleton condition (wearing and not wearing the HNSE). Using the HNSE, significantly alleviated perceived discomfort in the neck (p-value = 0.009), right shoulder (p-value = 0.05) and left shoulder (p-value = 0.02) and reduced electromyographic activity of the right (p-value = 0.005) and left (p-value = 0.01) sternocleidomastoid muscles. However, utilizing the exoskeleton caused a remarkable increase in right (p-value = 0.04) and left (p-value = 0.05) trapezius electromyographic activities. Performance was not significantly affected by the HNSE. Although the HNSE had promising effects with respect to discomfort and muscular activity in the static overhead task, future work is still needed to investigate its effect on performance and to provide support for the generalizability of study results.}

This study sought to determine if an anti-fatigue mat (AFM) could uniquely affect low back pain (LBP), low back posture, and foot-floor interface responses in individuals prone to developing LBP (termed pain developers (PDs)) during prolonged standing experiments compared to those who do not develop LBP under the same exposures (termed non pain developers (NPDs)). Sixteen volunteers (8 PDs and 8 NPDs) were recruited based on their pain-development tendencies, which were established in previous standing experiments. They visited the laboratory on two separate days for 60 min of light manual work while standing on either a rigid floor or AFM. All participants were asymptomatic at the beginning of each experimental session. The amount of LBP experienced during the standing exposure, measured via a visual analogue scale, was reduced (p = 0.03) in the PD group when on the AFM (3.6 ± 6 mm) compared to the rigid floor (6.8 ± 7 mm). LBP levels remained low and unchanged (p = 0.5) between the AFM (2.4 ± 5 mm) and rigid floor (1.6 ± 2 mm) conditions for the NPD group. Neither postural nor foot-floor interface measures correlated with this unique reduction of LBP for the PD group when standing on the AFM. The AFM did, however, increase centre of pressure excursion (NPD 55% increase; PD 35% increase) and tended to increase the number of body weight shifts (NPD 116% increase; PD 54% increase) in both the PD and NPD groups. These findings suggest that AFMs may selectively benefit individuals prone to developing standing-induced back pain by facilitating subtle movements at the foot-floor interface.}

The Simon task probes inhibition using interfering stimuli, i.e., cues spatially presented on the opposite side of the indicated response; incongruent response times (RT) are slower than congruent RTs. Operational applicability of the Simon task beyond finger/hand manipulations and visual/auditory cues is unclear, but important to consider as new technologies provide tactile cues and require motor responses from the lower extremity (e.g., exoskeletons). In this study, twenty participants completed the Simon task under four conditions, each combination of two cue (visual/tactile) and response (upper/lower-extremity) modalities. RT were significantly longer for incongruent than congruent cues across cue-response pairs. However, alternative cue-response pairs yielded slower RT and decreased accuracy for tactile cues and lower-extremity responses. Results support operational usage of the Simon task to probe inhibition using tactile cues and lower-extremity responses relevant for new technologies like exoskeletons and immersive environments.}

This article analyses the pandemic's effects in the access of riverine communities to the prehospital emergency healthcare system in the Brazilian Upper Amazon River region. To do so, we present two studies that by using a Resilience Engineering approach aimed to predict the functioning of the Brazilian Mobile Emergency Medical Service (SAMU) for riverside and coastal areas during the COVID-19 pandemic, based on the normal system functioning. Study I, carried out before the pandemic, applied ethnographic methods for data collection and the Functional Resonance Analysis Method - FRAM for data analysis in order to develop a model of the mobile emergency care in the region during typical conditions of operation. Study II then estimated how changes in variability dynamics would alter system functioning during the pandemic, arriving at three trends that could lead the service to collapse. Finally, the accuracy of predictions is discussed after the pandemic first peaked in the region. Findings reveal that relatively small changes in variability dynamics can deliver strong implications to operating care and safety of expeditions aboard water ambulances. Also, important elements that add to the resilient capabilities of the system are extra-organizational, and thus during the pandemic safety became jeopardized as informal support networks grew fragile. Using FRAM for modelling regular operation enabled prospective scenario analysis that accurately predicted disruptions in providing emergency care to riverine population.}

abstract = {Background
Failure to rescue (FTR) denotes mortality from post-operative complications after surgery with curative intent. High-volume, low-mortality units have similar complication rates to others, but have lower FTR rates. Effective response to the deteriorating post-operative patient is therefore critical to reducing surgical mortality. Resilience Engineering might afford a useful perspective for studying how the management of deterioration usually succeeds and how resilience can be strengthened.
Methods
We studied the response to the deteriorating patient following emergency abdominal surgery in a large surgical emergency unit, using the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM). FRAM focuses on the conflicts and trade-offs inherent in the process of response, and how staff adapt to them, rather than on identifying and eliminating error. 31 semi-structured interviews and two workshops were used to construct a model of the response system from which conclusions could be drawn about possible ways to strengthen system resilience.
Results
The model identified 23 functions, grouped into five clusters, and their respective variability. The FRAM analysis highlighted trade-offs and conflicts which affected decisions over timing, as well as strategies used by staff to cope with these underlying tensions. Suggestions for improving system resilience centred on improving team communication, organisational learning and relationships, rather than identifying and fixing specific system faults.
Conclusion
FRAM can be used for analysing surgical work systems in order to identify recommendations focused on strengthening organisational resilience. Its potential value should be explored by empirical evaluation of its use in systems improvement.}

To quantify workload, four dependent variables (muscle activity, estimated grip force, subjective comfort rating, and task time) were measured. The muscular activity required while using the conventional device was 14.4% MVC (Maximum voluntary contraction) for the scanning task, which was significantly higher than that of the ergonomic device. The subjective comfort rating for the conventional design was lower than that of the ergonomic design. For the positioning task, the ergonomic device (33.2% MVC) resulted in significantly higher muscle activity in the extensor digitorum (ED) and flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) than the conventional design (22.2% MVC), whereas the deltoid muscle showed significantly lower activity than in users of conventional design (4.5% MVC). Ergonomically-designed ultrasound devices improve ease of moving and the probe's supporters, reduce physical load and increase ease of use for sonographers. Our results may be used as guidelines for usability testing of ultrasound devices.}

The journey from ‘thinking humans’ to ‘systems thinking’ is demonstrated in this paper through the novel application of the Risk Management Framework (RMF) to the categorisation of research activities. A systematic review of Neville's contributions to the field of road safety demonstrates that over the years, his research activities have evolved from investigating single technological or human performance aspects in isolation (e.g., in-vehicle information design and workload) through to the holistic analysis of much broader systems (e.g., investigating road safety as a whole). Importantly, this evolution goes hand in hand with a change in the focus and emphasis of recommendations for improvements to safety. Going forward, Neville has helped pave the way for fundamental changes and improvements to be made to road safety systems around the world.}

However, limited research has been done to understand user interaction with AR interfaces, which may lead to poor usability, risk of occupational hazards, and low acceptance of AR systems. This paper uses a theoretically-driven approach to interaction design to investigate the impact of different AR modalities in terms of information mode (i.e. video vs. 3D animation) and interaction modality (i.e. hand-gesture vs. voice command) on user performance, workload, eye gaze behaviours, and usability during a maintenance assembly task. The results show that different information modes have distinct impacts compared to paper-based maintenance, in particular, 3D animation led to a 14% improvement over the video instructions in task completion time. Moreover, insights from eye gaze behaviours such as number of fixations and transition between Areas of Interest (AOIs) revealed the differences in attention switching and task comprehension difficulty with the choice of AR modalities. While, subjective user perceptions highlight some ergonomic issues such as misguidance and overreliance, which must be considered and addressed from the joint cognitive systems’ (JCSs) perspective and in line with the predictions derived from the Multiple Resources Model.}

Important factors, including design and planning decisions, contributing to accidents are hereby often overlooked and the weaknesses in the Safety Management System are hardly ever analysed. The SAfety FRactal ANalysis (SAFRAN) method (Accou and Reniers, 2019) can guide investigators in an intuitive and logic way, to ask questions that help to gain deeper understanding of the capability of organisations to monitor and manage safety critical variability. The essence of using the SAFRAN method for evaluating the performance of the different processes in a socio-technical system, is to approach them in a similar way, building on the generic elements that compose a SMS and systematically looking at the HOF that influenced actions and decision making, regardless of the hierarchical level they are situated at. This paper presents the SAFRAN method, specifying its HOF taxonomy and sharing examples of supporting HOF questions. The approach enables non-experts in HOF to systematically identify the different elements that introduce critical variability in performance and to recognise what additional expertise can be called upon when needed.}

To investigate the effect of sex and load carriage on cardiorespiratory responses to high intensity exercise in male and female soldiers.
Methods
Soldiers (9 women, 9 men) performed a graded treadmill test until exhaustion with no load (NL) and combat-gear with body armor (CG). Cohen's d effect sizes, paired t-tests and ANOVA were used to study differences between conditions. A mixed linear regression model analyzed the relationship between heart rate (HR) and oxygen uptake (V̇O2) with load and between sexes.
Results
Wearing CG resulted in, for both sexes, a decreased time to exhaustion (−11 min), lower V̇O2peak (L/min) ES = 0.56; VO2peak (mL//kg/min) ES = 2.44, both p < 0.001, a net decrease in minute ventilation (ES = 3.53) and no change in HRmax. No sex-difference were present except for absolute V̇O2peak. The VO2 and HR relationship showed a cardiorespiratory reduction wearing CG vs. NL. Added load was equal between sexes, although female soldiers' CG relative to body mass was higher (25%) than male soldiers’ (20%), p < 0.01.
Conclusion
Wearing CG reduces soldiers’ cardiorespiratory capacity and exercise performance level, although the reduction cannot be explained solely based on the added load of CG, instead CG seems to restrict the capacity to fully ventilate. No sex differences were found in relative cardiorespiratory responses to wearing CG compared to NL.}

Developers should create VR experiences that minimise negative symptoms of cybersickness and postural instability experience by new users of VR.}

abstract = {User Interface (UI) design practices often abide by popular usability heuristics such as Nielsen’s (1994) “10 usability heuristics for user interface design” or Gerhardt–Powals' (1996) cognitive engineering principles. To examine the underlying mechanism of user performance enhancement by following some of these usability heuristics, we compared user performance between two device conditions: one representing design practices following two selected sets of usability heuristics (experimental condition) and the other without following them (control condition). As a research framework, we adopted the psychological–refractory–period (PRP) paradigm along with the locus–of–slack logic, a well–established dual–task paradigm for examining the nature of cognitive benefits caused by experimental manipulations. Results showed that the experimental–device condition that followed the usability heuristics yielded faster performance than the control condition, especially when the stimulus–onset–asynchrony between the two tasks was long than when it was short. According to the locus–of–slack logic, these results suggest that the nature of cognitive benefits caused by following the usability heuristics is more likely to be due to shortening of the response–activation stage (rather than the response–selection stage). These findings suggest that following the two usability heuristics tends to facilitate a specific stage of the information processes more than other stages.}

Sixty-six participants were required to identify the meaning and priority of four different clinical alarms for one of the two styles of alarm (between-subjects).

The results add to the growing body of evidence supporting the use of auditory icon alarms in clinical environments.}

Air traffic controllers (ATCOs) completed retrospectively a specific questionnaire assessing the effects of shift schedule (modified vs. initial) and of traffic load on fatigue, alertness (on-shift, upon awakening, during daily non-work activities), and sleep (duration, satisfaction). Work organization had marginal and unexpected effects, which might indicate ATCOs' disapproval of the intervention. Traffic load affected sleep satisfaction and alertness during work and non-work activities. Specific effects of shift included reduced sleep time prior to morning shifts compared to night shifts, whereas alertness and fatigue were rated at comparable levels for both shifts. Results suggest that shiftwork features which favor sleep loss across a work cycle have deleterious consequences on alertness and increase the need for recovery, which are further enhanced by traffic load.}

This study compares the effect of two different seats (S1 – soft & S2 – firm) and the effect of visual simulation of different road types (city, highway, mountain, country), on pressure distribution and perceived discomfort during prolonged driving. Twenty participants drove two 3-h sessions (one per seat) on a static simulator. Contact Pressure (CP), Contact Surface (CS), and Seat Pressure Distribution Percentage (SPD%) were analyzed throughout, using two pressure mats positioned on seat cushion and backrest. Whole-body and local discomfort for each body part were rated every 20 min. The softer seat, S1, induced a greater contact surface on cushion and backrest and a lower SPD%, reflecting better pressure distribution. Pressure profiles were asymmetrical for both S1 and S2, with higher CP under left buttock (LBu) and right lower back (RLb) and greater CS under thighs and RLb. Pressure distribution was less homogeneous on mountain and city roads than on monotonous roads (highway and country). Despite the pressure differences between the seats, however, both led to similar increases in perceived whole-body discomfort throughout the driving session. Moreover, the highest discomfort scores were in the neck and the lower back areas, whatever the seat. These findings on pressure variables may have implications for the design of backrests and cushions to ensure more homogeneous pressure distribution, even though this is not shown to minimize perceived driver discomfort.}

The repetitive and cognitive demanding task operations of smart manufacturing require the development of system models for measuring and predicting human performance, including oil refinery monitoring tasks. The main objective of this research was to validate the generalizability of a mathematical model for the prediction of refinery operators' detection of abnormal events. Moreover, we examined operators' visual behaviors in response to abnormal situations at different ages and with different task loads, task complexities, and input devices. We found that participants had lower mean fixation durations, total fixation numbers, and fixation/saccade ratios when they were in the condition of a touchscreen device. Moreover, we found that older adults had higher mean saccade durations and saccade amplitudes when they were in the condition of a touchscreen device. Finally, the statistical model borrowed from our prior paper was found to be generalizable to different task loads and age groups for the prediction of operators’ detection of abnormal events. Our results showed that visual behaviors can indicate specific internal states of participants, including their cognitive workload, attention, and situation awareness in a real-time manner. The findings provide additional support for the value of using visual behavior to predict responsiveness of oil refinery operators and for future applications of smart manufacturing monitoring systems.}

Even with participants placing their feet 16.5 cm wider when seated on the ball, the perceived fall risk was significantly greater. Centre of pressure displacement tended to be smaller under the ball for lateral reach directions, but larger during far anterior reaches. While not statistically significant, the medial-lateral margin of stability was on average 3.4 cm smaller on the ball.

Multimodal signals are gaining attention in ADAS warning design because they offer redundant information that facilitates human–system communication. However, no consensus has been reached on which multimodal design offers optimal benefit to road safety. Icons iconically map the real world and are associated with fast recognition and response time. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether visual and auditory icons will benefit the effectiveness of audiovisual multimodal warnings. Thirty-two participants (16 females) experienced four types of unimodal warnings (high and low mapping visual warnings and high and low mapping auditory warnings) and four types of audiovisual warnings (high mapping visual + high mapping auditory warning, low mapping visual + low mapping auditory warning, high mapping visual + low mapping auditory warning, and low mapping visual + high mapping auditory warning) in simulated driving conditions. Visual warnings are presented in a head-up display. Results showed that multimodal warnings outperformed unimodal warnings (i.e., modality effect). We found mapping effect in audiovisual warnings, but only high mapping auditory constituents benefited warning effectiveness. Eye movement results revealed that the high mapping constituents might distract drivers from the road. This study adds evidence that multimodal warnings can offer extra benefits to drivers and high mapping auditory signals should be included in multimodal warning design to achieve better driving performance.}

Six participants performed standing, walking, lifting/lowering, carrying, side-to-side load transferring (i.e., 5.7 kg and 12.5 kg), and pushing/pulling.

Pilots' underappreciating or ignoring the time delay may be the major cause of two fatal accidents. No studies have connected spatial awareness with accidents. This study evaluated how delayed radar information affects the spatial awareness of pilots at three levels of analysis. Thirty-one student pilots and flight instructors completed three sequential estimation tasks (i.e., the current location of storms, the current relative distance to storms, and the future relative distance to storms). Fifty-four weather scenarios were developed for three factors (storm speeds, delays, displays) and presented to pilots. The results indicated that delays and the storm speed significantly affected the three levels of spatial awareness. Participants' estimation accuracy was the lowest under long delay and fast speed in the current location estimation, under medium delay and speed in the current distance estimation, and under short delay and slow speed in the future distance estimation. Spatial awareness could be high under the long delay and fast speed conditions if pilots had no time limits. Thus, pilots can process 20-min delayed radar information. However, there were no differences in estimation accuracy between the static and animation displays in any of the conditions. Well-designed features on displays, such as scale or distance measuring tools, can aid pilots’ spatial estimation and support all levels of spatial awareness.}

The aim of this study was to develop a theory-driven HIT acceptance model to examine factors affecting acceptance of HIT (measured by behavioral intention; BI) for disease self-management among patients with chronic diseases, in which we also focused on three additional, previously unexplored factors related to perceived hand function (PHF), perceived visual function (PVF), and perceived space adequacy (PSA) and a longitudinal scrutinization of changes in the effects of these factors on acceptance over time.
Methods
The theoretical basis of our acceptance model was drawn from the technology acceptance model and the theory of planned behavior. The model was further extended by including patients' PHF, PVF (related to patients with chronic diseases who are mostly elderly), and PSA (related to the patients’ home environment). The model was tested in the context of type 2 diabetes and hypertension self-management via a touchscreen tablet-based system over a 24-week period. A questionnaire was administered at four time points (baseline and 8, 16, and 24 weeks after implementation) to collect data from 151 patients with coexisting type 2 diabetes and hypertension. We tested the model at each time point using partial least squares structural equation modeling.
Results
Perceived usefulness of the self-management system influenced BI directly at 8 and 24 weeks and indirectly at 8, 16, and 24 weeks. Perceived ease of use indirectly affected BI at 8, 16, and 24 weeks. Attitude directly affected BI at 8, 16, and 24 weeks. Perceived behavioral control directly influenced BI at baseline and 8 and 16 weeks. Subjective norms indirectly influenced BI at 8, 16, and 24 weeks. PHF and PVF indirectly influenced BI over the entire study period. PSA influenced BI directly at 16 weeks and indirectly at 8, 16, and 24 weeks.
Conclusion
The effects of the proposed factors in our model on patient-focused HIT acceptance changed over a longer time period, emphasizing the importance of further investigation of the longitudinal mechanisms influencing technology acceptance behavior. It is recommended that healthcare practitioners consider such changes when implementing comparable technologies. Moreover, beyond technology attributes, the characteristics, needs, and limitations of older adults and elderly patient users and their home environments should also be considered in the design and implementation of patient-focused HIT systems for chronic disease self-management at home.}

Engaging in eco-driving did however have a positive effect on self-esteem, suggesting potential longer term psychological benefits of adopting this behaviour.}

Our recent field study showed that a new generation of winter footwear incorporating composite outsoles was able to reduce slips and falls on icy surfaces by 68% and 78%, respectively. The widespread adoption of this type of footwear may lead to substantial reductions in pain, suffering and costs of fall-related injuries. However, these composite materials are sensitive to wear and abrasion, which makes it likely that their slip-resistance performance may degrade with use. The goal of this pilot study was to determine the extent to which the slip-resistance of two types of winter footwear with composite outsoles changed as they wore down with real-world use. Seven participants were recruited for this study and were asked to walk 100K steps with their assigned footwear. Tread depth and slip–resistance performance (using the Maximum Achievable Angle test) were measured at baseline and again after each 25K-step interval up to 100K. Our results showed that the slip-resistance performance of the test footwear dropped significantly after the 75K and 100K step intervals compared to baseline. In addition, significant changes in tread depth were found after only 25K steps. These findings indicate that the performance of this type of footwear degrades relatively quickly with real-world use. Therefore, larger scale study of the slip-resistance of winter footwear with composite outsoles is needed and members of the public should be made aware of the potential loss of slip-resistance of these products.}

Stress also impairs brain activity in the prefrontal cortex, which communicates with the motor areas of the brain to regulate exercise and motor performance. To develop ergogenic strategies for the aging workforce, mind (brain)-body mechanisms behind the effect of stress on neuromuscular performance need to be well understood. This study investigated the influence of social stress on motor performance and information flow between the frontal and motor regions of the brain during intermittent handgrip contractions among older adults. Thirty older adults, balanced by gender, performed intermittent handgrip contractions at 30% of maximum strength before and after being subjected to a social stressor. Force steadiness, strength loss, root mean square electromyogram (EMG) activity, activation of the brain regions, and functional and effective connectivity between the frontal and motor brain regions were computed for pre- and post-stressor handgrip contractions. Older men exhibited improved motor performance after the stressor and concomitant reduction in functional connectivity between the frontal-motor brain regions ipsilateral to the contracting hand. Additionally, while both sexes exhibited significant causal information flow, i.e., effective connectivity, from the frontal to the motor regions of the brain, irrespective of the stressor, older women exhibited a bidirectional effective connectivity between the frontal-motor brain regions after the stressor. Stress had a facilitative effect on the motor performance of older men through compensatory brain network reorganization. Older women exhibited comparable motor performance pre/post stress, despite showing an increase in bidirectional information flow between the frontal-motor areas. Employing brain hemodynamics can facilitate better understanding of the impact of stress on neuromuscular performance and its differential impacts on brain network reorganization between the sexes.}

This paper provides a perceptual validation of sound environment reproduction inside aircraft mock-up. To provide a faithfully reproduced sound environment, time, frequency and spatial characteristics should be preserved. Physical sound field reproduction approaches for spatial sound reproduction are required while properly preserving localization cues at the listener's ears to recreate a realistic and immersing sound environment. We report a perceptual validation of a sound field reproduction system developed in an aircraft mock-up based on multichannel least-square methods and equalization. Twenty participants evaluated reproduced sound environments relative to a reference sound environment in an aircraft cabin mock-up equipped with a 41-actuator multichannel sound reproduction system.

Studying the acceptance of exoskeletons in industry has gained increased attention. Exoskeletons (wearable support devices) are envisioned to alleviate heavy work. Examining what factors influence the use of exoskeletons is important, because influencing these factors could positively contribute to the adoption of industrial exoskeletons. The factors identified in this paper have been systematically derived from empirical research with (potential future) end users, most of whom have tried on an exoskeleton. Our framework with factors influencing the acceptance of industrial exoskeletons can be used during the (ideally iterative) design, (re)development and evaluation phase of new or existing exoskeletons. This could improve the quality of exoskeletons since this allows designers to already consider acceptance factors early in the design process instead of finding out what is important late in the design process during (field) testing. In turn, this might accelerate the adoption of exoskeletons. Also, our framework can be used to study the ongoing introduction of exoskeletons at work since it also addresses policy decisions companies interested in implementing exoskeletons should consider.}

abstract = {Historically, PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) has generally been designed around the size and shape of an average European or US white man's face and body. There is little academic evidence to support anecdotal reports that women are at a greater disadvantage than men from ill-fitting PPE. This is especially relevant in healthcare settings where women make up at least 75% of frontline workers. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated problems associated with the fit of PPE that until now have been mainly anecdotal. This research presents results and analysis of a quantitative and qualitative survey concerning the fit of PPE worn by 248 healthcare workers, in a variety of healthcare roles and settings, during the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis of the survey results showed that women were less likely than men to feel safe carrying out their roles, with only 30.5% of women and 53.3% of men stating that they felt safe all of the time. A statistically significant link is made between women suffering more with poor fit than men with certain categories of PPE (gowns, masks, visors, goggles). Over four times as many women (54.8%) as men (13.3%) reported their surgical gowns being large to some degree and women were nearly twice as likely (53.5%) to experience oversized surgical masks than men (28.6%). However, it was recognized that PPE fit problems are not exclusive to women as many men also do not conform to the underlying shape and size of PPE designs. Survey results indicated that both sexes felt equally hampered due to the fit of their PPE and around a third of both women and men had modified their PPE to address fit issues. Oversized and modified PPE presents its own set of unintended consequences. Following strict processes for doffing and removing PPE is key to virus control but doffing modified PPE can fall outside of these processes, risking cross infection. In addition, wearers of critical items of PPE (such as respirators) currently undergo a “fit test”; however, fit does not reconcile with comfort and over-tightened PPE can cause headaches, discomfort and distraction when worn for long periods. Requirements and fit tests are also not setting-specific; qualitative responses from the survey give an indication that this must be a future consideration.}

Hand and foot movements and forces were recorded for 9 male and 10 female firefighters as they ascended and descended a 3.4-m ladder using elevated handrails (rail-climbing) or rungs (rung-climbing) for hand support. The results indicated that climbers used three or more points of contact 54% of the time for rung-climbing and 100% of the time for rail-climbing. Furthermore, rail-climbing was 10% faster than rung-climbing. In rail-climbing, the lateral hand forces were mostly directed away from the body; while during rung-climbing, they were alternated in lateral and medial directions. Overall, the results suggested that rail-climbing provides better control over body positioning and faster climbing speed. Furthermore, the continuous contact of both hands in rail-climbing may reduce the fall risk by facilitating the recovery from a slip or perturbation.}

Incident reporting and learning systems are a fundamental component of safety management. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a novel incident reporting system specific to the Australian Led Outdoor Activity (LOA) sector. The Understanding and Preventing Led Outdoor Accidents Data System (UPLOADS), is a recently introduced systems thinking-based incident reporting and learning system that utilises contemporary safety theory and methods.
Method
The implementation of UPLOADS was evaluated using the RE-AIM framework based on the following dimensions: Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance. A pragmatic evaluation approach was used in which evaluation data were collected through the triangulation of multiple sources including different LOA stakeholders from both the individual organisational level (LOA providers) and LOA sector governance level (LOA industry representatives), incident data collected through the UPLOADS National Incident Dataset, and the online and physical presence of UPLOADS.
Results
The findings show that a key strength of UPLOADS is its effectiveness as incident reporting tool for improving safety in the LOA sector. However, a weakness of UPLOADS is that it is not being implemented appropriately by the LOA providers.
Conclusion
Overall, the current findings suggest that UPLOADS incident reporting tool is perceived by SMEs as an effective tool for improving safety in LOA. However, further work is required for UPLOADS to have a greater impact on the LOA sector. Specifically, Implementation of the UPLOADS system requires improvement, as well as additional training and education may be required to upskill and empower LOA providers to improve reporting and enhance the value placed on safety by LOA stakeholders. The RE-AIM framework was an appropriate evaluation framework for understanding the effectiveness of UPLOADS as a LOA sector specific incident reporting and learning system.
Practical applications
The current findings have practical implications for ergonomics researchers applying evaluation frameworks in the real world, and LOA providers for implementing safety interventions. Lastly, contemporary systems-based incident reporting and learning systems have the capability to enhance the safety practices of the LOA sector.}

A significant contribution has been to initiate a shift from considering individual human operator situation awareness to considering the situation awareness of human and non-human teams, organisations, and even sociotechnical systems. Though controversial when introduced, the distributed situation awareness model has become increasingly relevant for modern day systems and problems. In this article we reflect on Stanton's contribution and point to a pressing need to consider a. The situation awareness of advanced technologies, and b. situation awareness at a sociotechnical system, societal and even global level. This is demonstrated via discussion on two contemporaneous issues: automated vehicles and the COVID-19 pandemic.

The recorded data was combined with a 3D scan and evaluated by an algorithm which determined the separation plane of the measuring handle to integrate the force sensors. This plane is perpendicular to the vector of the subjects’ grip forces. Furthermore, it divides the knob-shaped handle of the sander primarily vertically.

Participants were also asked to rate their perceived levels of exertion and cleanliness of each mopping system.
Results
The use of wet wipes had the highest repetition count and exertion rates during mopping and scrubbing tasks. Higher peak scrubbing forces were noted for the plunge mop. All participants found the cotton fibre mop to be the cleanest. All 3 mops had medium postural risk.
Conclusion
The advantages and disadvantages of each mopping system were outlined and may be used by occupational therapists when providing ergonomic advice to patients with upper limb musculoskeletal conditions.}

Generalized estimating equation analysis for repeated measurements with backward elimination was used to examine associations with MSCs. In total, 79% of students experienced MSCs. Female sex (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.22–0.62), lifting and bending (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00–1.03), physical job demands (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.68–3.22) and need for recovery (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01–1.03), were statistically significantly associated with overall MSCs. Models for regional complaints are also presented in this article. Nursing school and clinical placement staff should consider these factors when dealing with nursing students with MSCs.}

However, this is not exclusive with work system design ahead of time, with the deliberate intention of influencing resilient performance. This paper proposes a concept and principles of Design for Resilient Performance (DfRP), making explicit contributions that had been concealed and fragmented in the literature. Based on a literature review of influential human factors studies, 23 design principles were identified and set a basis for a Delphi study with 27 experts from nine countries. After three Delphi rounds, consensus was obtained and the DfRP concept was defined as well as seven design principles, namely: (i) there must be functional models of the system; (ii) make variations in performance visible; (iii) use the type of standardization that best fits the nature of the function; (iv) design slack resources and strategies; (v) design for acceptable performance even under degraded conditions; (vi) design must involve leveraging diverse perspectives; and (vii) design to support continuous learning at the individual and organisational level. The applicability of the principles is demonstrated through an exploratory case study of the rapid response team in a hospital. The principles of DfRP are contributions of prescriptive nature, which might give rise to more resilient socio-technical systems.}

abstract = {Now and in the coming years a new European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) is being deployed on a larger scale. In the system level chosen in the Netherlands (Level 2) lineside signals will disappear and the train driver will receive all information needed for safe and efficient train operation through an interface inside the train cab. Furthermore, procedures, driving skills and communication will alter. Many train drivers will thus need to be trained in driving with ERTMS. Train operating companies (TOC) have to decide on efficient and effective strategies to organise this extensive training volume and to reassure that drivers become and remain proficient after training when roll-out of ERTMS may not have been fully completed. In this paper the central questions to be answered are: How many hours/duties does a driver have to do during a certain period of time on an ERTMS track section to become proficient with ERTMS (learning period), and to stay proficient (retaining period)? The approach taken is unique for rail industry (to the authors' knowledge) and is based on big data analyses. In this study, we were able to study the collective performance of train drivers, by big data analysis while at the same time maintaining privacy through pseudonymisation of the train driver database and their individual performances, characteristics and other potential privacy sensitive data. Databases containing detailed information on all planned and accomplished train service times/positions of the last three years (2015–2017) of a large TOC were combined with personal data from HR databases (age, experience, ERTMS training history, job assessment results, etcetera). From the data, delays caused by rolling stock and train operating related issues were identified. The amount and duration of these delays were correlated with the personal data to test research hypotheses. Again, at the same time we maintained privacy of the individuals’ personal data. Although the research has some limitations due to the small amount of existing ERTMS lines, and associated rolling stock, the results show some clear correlations. Thus, quantifiable directions to the minimum amount of ERTMS driving per 3 months during the first year and in the years after are presented. The results are now being translated into models for training and rostering related to the phase of ERTMS roll-out.}

Independent variables were Noise (Broadband - 0dBA vs. 75dBA above background) and Cognitive Workload (Low vs. High, manipulated via presence of a secondary task). Among females, broadband noise significantly impaired performance in low workload, but significantly improved performance in high workload. In contrast, among males broadband noise had no significant effect on overall performance. From an applied perspective, understanding the interaction between noise, cognitive workload and sex allows for the design of a training environment to ensure maximum performance by all staff.}

Like other types of face masks, however, user discomfort while wearing cloth masks is thought to engender behaviors that limit the effectiveness of cloth masks as source control (e.g., adjusting or removing one's mask temporarily while in public). To design cloth masks that are more tolerable, a measurement instrument for assessing subjective user discomfort is needed. Across two studies, we identified and confirmed a two-dimensional factor structure underlying the discomfort of cloth masks – discomfort related to the breathability and discomfort related to the tightness of the mask against the face and head. Additionally, we provide replicable evidence that both factor-subscales predict the self-reported frequencies of problematic mask-wearing behaviors.}

To investigate the disparity in the specification and physiological demand of a task simulation when developed by two independent panels of experiential experts.
Design
Independent groups design.
Methods
Two groups of experiential experts from the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) worked independently to design, and then complete a simulation of a generic occupational task; the establishment of a security control point. Task duration, oxygen consumption, and cardiac frequency were measured whilst each panel completed the task simulation. Maximal acceptable work duration (MAWD) and the percentage of MAWD (%MAWD) were also calculated. Independent t-tests were used to determine differences (P < 0.05) between the measured variables.
Results
No differences were observed in the average oxygen consumption (1.26 ± 0.25 L min−1 and 1.28 ± 0.29 L min−1 respectively; P = 0.84), or cardiac frequency (134 ± 16.4 beats·min−1 and 125 ± 8.5 beats·min−1 respectively; P = 0.12) between Panel 1 and Panel 2. However, there was a significant difference between panels with respect to task duration (Panel 1: 15.5 ± 3.68 min; Panel 2: 34.20 ± 9.60 min; P < 0.01), and the %MAWD (Panel 1: 5.32 ± 3.17%, Panel 2: 12.15 ± 9.40%, P = 0.04).
Conclusions
The physiological demand of a task simulation is dependent upon the group of experts consulted to develop the simulation. It is critical that input from a wide representation of experiential experts is considered when developing task simulations to avoid bias towards the perceptions of the experts consulted.}

Twenty participants performed repetitive lifting under four constraints differing in restriction of foot movement and load weight. MV was assessed for three body regions and for the whole-body using linear variability of three-dimensional joint angles. Foot movement caused significant increases of lower body (11–17%), low back (318–439%) and a reduction in upper body variability (4%), whereas no effects of weight nor interaction of foot restriction and weight were found. Good individual consistency (ICC = 0.71–0.84) was demonstrated across constraints. Even though MV is affected by constraints, this study supports that MV is largely an individual trait independent of constraints. Future work should evaluate if MV remains an individual trait across different tasks, and if MV is confounded by other task constraints.}

Reaction times and accuracy served as measures of performance, and the visual behavior was assessed using the number and duration of eye fixations. Our findings suggest that visual clutter has a negative influence on performance and alters the visual behavior during visual search in action video game scenes. Our results also suggest that expert action video game players might use different visual strategies to cope with clutter, leading however to no performance benefits.}

The results indicated that the method, kernel density estimation, combined with location data offers significant opportunities to not only measure and compare spatial movement behaviours but also simultaneously identify the locations where the behaviours occur. Combined with other data streams, this method will allow researchers to further investigate the influence of different environmental characteristics on these behaviours, potentially leading the development of more effective, longer lasting interventions to promote movement and reduce stationary behaviour, ultimately improving the health of office workers.}

Six participants (4M, 2F) completed two such tasks (load carriage and stationary load transfer), both with and without a WB-PEXO, and with a range of load masses in each task. WB-PEXO use reduced median levels of muscle activity in the back (∼42–53% in thoracic and ∼24–43% in lumbar regions) and legs (∼41–63% in knee flexors and extensors), and mainly when handling loads beyond low-moderate levels (10–15 kg). Overall, using the WB-PEXO also reduced inter-individual variance (smaller SD) in muscle activities. Future work should examine diverse users, focus on finding effective matches between WB-PEXO use and specific tasks, and identify applications in varied work environments.}

abstract = {Serious falls occur frequently on stairs with inconsistent dimensions. Inconsistent smaller goings are thought to reduce user's foot clearances and foot contact lengths since individuals do not detect and alter their behaviour prior to the inconsistency, increasing the risk of a trip, heel-catch or over-step and potential slip on the stairs. So far, these mechanisms for a stair fall remain theoretical only. The aim of this paper was to identify the underlying mechanisms by which steps with inconsistent going size increase the risk of falls. For this study twenty-seven younger adults (24 ± 3 y, 1.74 ± 0.09 m, 71.41 ± 11.04 kg) and thirty-three older adults (70 ± 4 y, 1.68 ± 0.08 m, 67.90 ± 14.10 kg) ascended and descended a seven-step instrumented staircase in two conditions: 1) consistent dimensions with 200 mm risers and 250 mm goings and 2) inconsistent going dimensions where the going of the third step was reduced by 10 mm, and consequently the going of the second step was larger by 10 mm. Five repeated trials on the inconsistent stairs were performed to assess if there was an adaptation effect after first exposure. In descent in the first inconsistent trial, foot contact lengths were not significantly different between conditions for the younger and older adults on the inconsistently shorter step (∼1%, p = .121). Foot trajectories were pulled further back in the last 22% of swing before contact (p = .025), contradicting previous expectations. Younger adults then had reduced clearances over the next step (∼5 mm, p = .027), which was inconsistently longer, increasing the risk of a heel-catch, whereas foot clearances for older adults were not different. With repeated inconsistent trials the foot contact length of older adults reduced on the shorter step (p = .024). In ascent, in the first inconsistent trial, interaction effects were detected between groups and conditions on three steps: the inconsistently longer step (p = .003), the shorter step (p = .004), the next step (p = .006), as well as on the walkway (p = .048). Older adults positioned themselves further away from the stairs on the walkway compared to younger adults and then had a reduced foot contact length on the inconsistently shorter step (∼2.8%, p = .026), increasing the chances of under-stepping and slipping off the shorter step. Whereas younger adults were positioned closer to the stairs on the walkway, had increased foot contact lengths on the inconsistently longer step and contact lengths that were not different on the inconsistently shorter step. With repeated inconsistent trials, foot contact lengths were reduced on the longer step (p = .006) and then on the shorter step (p = .018). These findings contradict previous assumptions that individuals do not adapt to inconsistent goings on stairs. In descent on the first trial, both groups adjusted their stepping behaviour late in the swing prior to contact with the first inconsistent step. In ascent younger adults made changes to their position and stepping behaviour before stepping on the stairs. These behaviours to mitigate the risk of the inconsistent step, did not persist in the repeat trials. Future investigations should establish the magnitude at which inconsistencies are detectable and can be acted upon and should include a wider range of individuals. This type of research could help inform future initiatives to prevent serious stair falls.}

Participants included 20 circulating nurses (CNs) and 16 nurse anesthetists (NAs) who completed a total of 70 operations in which each operation required one CN and one NA. The experiment was separated into a control group (operating noise only) vs. an experimental group (3 different music types-between subjects and 2 music volume levels-within-subjects). Results showed that all participants had excellent situation awareness performance despite their mental workload showing significant differences in various phases of the surgery. Music at 55–60 dB caused lower mental workloads and anxiousness for nurses than those exposed to levels of 75–80 dB. When Mozart's music was played, the participants' mental workload and situation anxiety were lower than when exposed to other music types. Music played at 60 dB during an operation may be a feasible solution to mitigate the negative effects of extra noise and thus improve the nurses' performance.}

However, the impact of these DAS on human factors aspects and safety performance is unclear. The current study assesses the impact of two DAS levels (route context information and coasting advice) on mental workload, attention allocation and safety performance, using eye tracking, a subjective mental workload rating scale (RSME) and simulator data. The overall findings suggest that the application of DAS levels has no negative impact on safety performance and attention allocation towards the trackside compared to a control condition with static timetable information. Furthermore, safety performance benefits significantly from DAS with route context information. DAS were originally developed to benefit punctuality and energy efficiency goals. This study implicates that DAS can also benefit safety performance. The current study found that DAS could decrease workload when the functionalities meet the requirements of the situation. The possible presence of mental underload and its effect on driving performance should be taken into consideration when implementing DAS. It is essential in the development of DAS that it meaningfully enriches the train driving task in stead of simply increasing mental workload.}

However, our recent work failed to replicate the finding of the original study, calling for further replication efforts. Experiment 1 aimed to fully replicate Muir and Moray (1996) where participants performed a simulated pasteurizer task. Experiment 2 attempted to replicate Experiment 1 using participants who major in Engineering as used in the original study. Both experiments showed that dependability was the best initial predictor of trust, building later to predictability and faith. Two experiments consistently failed to support both the hypothesis proposed by Muir and Moray (1996), that trust develops from predictability to dependability to faith, and their original findings that trust develops initially from faith. The results of the current experiments challenge this widely cited view of how human-machine trust develops. Modern automation designers should be aware that dependability might control initial trust development for general users and incorporate dependability information into their designs.}

The WoDs were characterized by a cross tabulation video coding method, and by measuring vertical force applied and the parameters of upper limb kinematics, as well as these measures’ approximate entropy (ApEN). Five main different WoDs were used. Although most participants varied their WoD, neither participant age nor work pace affected the number of WoD they used. However, the WoDs differed from each other by the sequence of movements and by the level of ApEn of their kinematic variables without interfering with the production rate. Allowing operators to vary their WoDs when performing repetitive tasks could reduce strain on the locomotor system.}

Earlier studies have indicated that tasks with a higher perceptual or cognitive load in the visual modality influence the processing of auditory stimuli. It is unclear, however, whether other factors, such as memory failure, active neglect, or expectancy influence the effect of cognitive load on auditory alarm detection sensitivity during aeronautical decision-making. In this study, we investigated this issue in three laboratory experiments using the technique of signal detection analysis, in which participants were asked to make a landing decision based on indicators of the instrument landing system while also trying to detect an audible alarm. We found that the sensitivity of auditory alarm detection was reduced under conditions of high cognitive load and that this effect persisted even when the auditory detection response occurred first (before the landing decision response) and when the probability of an auditory alarm was 40%. However, the sensitivity of auditory detection was not influenced by cognitive load under high expectancy conditions (60% probability of alarm presentation). Furthermore, the value of the response bias was reduced under high cognitive load conditions when the probability of an auditory alarm was low (20%). With an increase in the level of expectancy (40% and 60% probability of alarm presentation), it was found that cognitive load did not influence the response bias. These findings indicate that visual cognitive load affects the sensitivity to an auditory alarm only at a low expectancy level (20% and 40% probability of alarm presentation). The effect of cognitive load on the sensitivity to an auditory alarm was not due to memory failure or active neglect and the response bias was more sensitive to the expectancy factor.}

Bra fit assessments were included for both bras. All participants failed the bra fit assessment when wearing the Usual bra and 67% (n=16) failed when wearing the PFB.

This study also quantified the contributions of under-shoe fluid drainage to friction in NSR shoes. The coefficient of friction (ACOF) and under-shoe fluid pressures of fifteen NSR shoes were measured. A previously developed ACOF prediction model based on measurable outsole features was applied to the NSR shoes. The previously developed model did not apply well (in trends, as indicated by interaction effects involving SR/NSR classification, or in magnitude, p < 0.001) to NSR shoes. Instead, an increase in the fluid pressures were associated with a reduction in ACOF (p < 0.001). This study demonstrates that fluid pressures dominate performance in NSR shoes in contrast to SR shoes.}

Twenty general aviation student pilots were randomized into control and experimental groups. Dwell time, return time, entropy, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and deviations from flight paths were compared before and after training to straight-and-level-flight (LF) and standard left level turn (LT) scenarios. After the training, the experimental pilots significantly increased dwell time on primary instruments (PIs), reduced randomness in visual search, and fixated on the PIs in shorter times (in the scenario of LT). In terms of piloting, all experimental pilots successfully kept the aircraft control while five control pilots lost control in IMC; significant differences in altitude and rate of climb deviations were observed between groups (in the scenario of LF).}

Typically, the cases presented to the histopathologist have already been classified as ‘abnormal’ by clinical examination and/or other diagnostic tests. This results in a high disease prevalence, the potential for ‘abnormality priming’, and a response bias leading to false positives on normal cases. This study investigated whether higher cue utilisation is associated with a reduction in positive response bias in the diagnostic decisions of histopathologists. Data were collected from eighty-two histopathologists who completed a series of demographic and experience-related questions and the histopathology edition of the Expert Intensive Skills Evaluation 2.0 (EXPERTise 2.0) to establish behavioural indicators of context-related cue utilisation. They also completed a separate, diagnostic task comprising breast histopathology images where the frequency of abnormality was manipulated to create a high disease prevalence context for diagnostic decisions relating to normal tissue. Participants were assigned to higher or lower cue utilisation groups based on their performance on EXPERTise 2.0. When the effects of experience were controlled, higher cue utilisation was specifically associated with a greater accuracy classifying normal images, recording a lower positive response bias. This study suggests that cue utilisation may play a protective role against response biases in histopathology settings.}

We conducted twenty semi-structured interviews with caregivers. We performed upward abstraction and strategy mapping and identified seven work system constraints and eight strategies used to overcome constraints across three care events. We found that strategies used by caregivers either directly modified a constraint or emphasized other positive work system components to overcome a constraint. For example a caregiver modified their bathroom to support the PLWD in bathing themselves properly and safely.

Dual-task interference is a concern when users attempt to use head mounted displays (HMD) while performing seated manual control tasks. Auditory warnings of information displayed on the HMD may or may not assist users while multi-tasking.
Objective
In this study, we investigated the dual-task interference of words, to be remembered later, presented on a HMD and motor control in a manual tracking task. The word presentations were warned or not warned with auditory signals and the impact of audio warnings were examined.
Methods
Participants were required to perform five tasks: (1) a compensatory tracking task performed alone, (2) a word memory task performed alone, (3) a tracking and word memory task, (4) a word memory task with words preceded by audial signals, and (5) a tracking and word memory task with words preceded by audial signals. In addition, in the dual-tasks, half of the word presentations were paired with directions changes in the tracking task to test for immediate perceptual interference.
Results
There were significant dual task costs for both mean tracking error and later word recall. Additionally, participants took significantly longer to respond to motion changes paired with word presentations than motion changes not paired with word presentations. However, the impact of auditory warnings on tracking performance was nuanced.
Conclusion
Even with an in field of view transparent HMD momentary and sustained cognitive dual-task interference remains. Reaction times are affected most in the worst case scenario, when task critical events occur at the same time as a text message.
Application
The use of HMDs in time critical manual control tasks (such as operating machinery) should be limited. The use of audial warnings to alert operators to information displayed on an HMD requires further research; it may disrupt appropriate or natural task ordering.}

The inter- and intraindividual joint angle differences were calculated and some significant effects of stature, age, and gender on these joint angle differences were found. Additionally, significant correlations were found between posture preferences and joint angles, except for the lower extremities. The results show that the factors stature, age, gender, and posture preferences have influence on the preferred joint angles. However, other human-, vehicle-, and context-related factors also seem relevant and should be considered in future studies. The results provide important field-based knowledge for an application-oriented understanding of driving posture and for the human-centered design process of future vehicle interior research and development.}

Participants ground reaction forces and strength measures were assessed using a force platform and dynamometry, respectively. Testing included assessments before and after treadmill walking on days one and two, and 24 h following day 2. When assessed by mixed methods ANOVA (alpha: 0.05) statistically significant interaction effects were observed for loading peak (p = 0.031), loading rate (p = 0.035) and plantarflexor torque dynamometry variables at 60°s−1 (p = 0.011) and 120°s−1 (p = 0.024). Repeated measures correlation highlighted associations between plantarflexor torque at 60°s−1 and loading rate (r = −0.901, p < 0.001). Load carriage reduced lower limb torque which did not recover between days. Plantarflexor torque reductions were associated with increases in loading rate. Practitioners should consider that load bearers are more likely to experience lower limb injury during multi-day load carriage.

abstract = {There have been recent calls for Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE) to expand its reach and focus to address larger scale societal and global issues. An area of growing awareness is the issue of the gender data gap, whereby women are under-represented in research data, leading to inequitable outcomes when research findings are used to design real world technologies, products, environments, processes, and policies. The aim of this paper is to showcase how structured HFE methods can be used to address the gender data gap. We applied the Sociotechnical Systems Design Toolkit which involved using causal loop diagrams and abstraction hierarchy modelling from Cognitive Work Analysis to understand the system in which the issue occurs and key pain points, followed by the application of the Design with Intent Toolkit to generate design ideas. A total of 43 ideas were developed that could be implemented by universities to address the research data gap. The application demonstrates the utility of HFE methods in tackling complex issues and offers an opportunity for the HFE community to reflect upon the importance of gender sensitive research practices and gender equity more broadly.}

There is, however, a lack of field studies investigating which lighting characteristics are necessary to improve sleep and cognitive functioning. A controlled field study with 80 shift workers was set up, in which the impact of an integrative lighting (IL) scenario was investigated during the morning shift. Two groups were compared: a control group (no change in lighting settings) and a IL-group (exposed to a melanopic Equivalent Daylight Illuminance of 192 lux, i.e., bright light with a high fraction of short-wavelengths). Pre-post measurement of visual comfort, cognitive functioning (D2 task, go-nogo reaction time task) and sleep (MotionWatch8) were performed. The IL-settings ameliorated sleep efficiency and sleep latency during morning shift and enhanced alertness (not inhibition) compared to standard lighting conditions. Changing lighting settings in an industrial setting should be considered as it seems worthwhile for employees’ sleep and cognitive performance.}

The work process is a sequential removing, carrying, and depositing task performed by nine females and nine males and recorded using a motion capture system. The analysis shows that using experimental data results in larger back compression force during the removing task (average 15.4%), similar force during the depositing task (average 0.68%), and less force during the carrying task (19.875%). Using experimental data resulted in larger shoulder torque during all tasks (average 24.97%).}

However, the benefits of exoskeletons are yet to be realized in the operating room, particularly as work-related musculoskeletal disorders continue to be a concern for surgeons. This study quantified the effect of using neck, arm, and trunk exoskeletons on muscle activity while assuming typical postures held in the operating room. Fourteen participants were recruited to participate in this study. In this two-part experiment participants were asked to 1) hold a series of neck flexion, arm abduction and trunk flexion postures seen in surgical procedures, and 2) perform a simulated surgical task requiring five different trunk flexion posture levels. Participants were required to complete these tasks with and without passive exoskeleton(s). This study showed that even for postures held short time periods, exoskeletons are beneficial at reducing the demand on muscles; however, the reduction in muscle demand depends on body segment and postural angle, as intended with these passive exoskeletons. Furthermore, for the simulated surgical task with awkward trunk flexion postures (10–65°), the trunk exoskeletons showed a significant reduction in the rate of rise in back muscle sEMG (+1.365%MVC/min vs. +0.769%MVC/min for non-dominant lumbar extensor muscles, p = 0.0108; +1.377%MVC/min vs. +0.770%MVC/min for the dominant lumbar extensor muscles, p = 0.0196) over 25 min, consequently resulting in improved trunk subjective discomfort scores (7.34 vs. 4.30, p < 0.05), with no impact on the neck and shoulder biomechanical demand. The results from this study indicate that exoskeletons may be a potential intervention to reduce biomechanical loading during surgery.}

This study aimed to present occupational exposure limits for noise-induced non-auditory effects in healthy males using empirical exposure-response regression models based on the data of laboratory and ﬁeld considering the effective variables. To this end, the equivalent noise level was measured and recorded in four working settings including closed offices, open-plan offices, control rooms, and industrial workplaces during a normal working day. They were 65, 68, 73, and 80dB(A), respectively. In the laboratory, 31 healthy males were exposed to five noise conditions (four noisy conditions and one quiet) during 8 h and they were asked to perform the cognitive tests. In the ﬁeld phase, 124 healthy males were also examined from four working settings in their workstations for 8 h. The psychophysiological parameters of the participants were recorded in both lab and field. The results indicated variations in mental responses at levels above 55dBA, and psychophysiological variations at levels above 70dB(A) in both phases. The findings also showed that the developed regression models could plausibly predict the noise-induced psychophysiological responses during exposure to noise levels; thus, they can be presented the likely exposure limits. Based on the results of the models, the levels <55dB(A) are likelihood of the acoustic comfort limit, and the levels ranged from 55 to 65dB(A) are the acoustic safe limits. The acoustic caution limit is the likelihood of the levels ranged from 65 to 75dB(A). The levels ranged from 75 to 80dB(A) are likely the action levels or control limits, and the occupational exposure limit are the probability of levels> 80dB(A).}

Care transitions are complex, spatio-temporal processes and involve work during the transition (i.e., handoff and transport) and preparation and follow up activities (i.e., articulation work). Physicians defined the transition as starting earlier and ending later than nurses. Clinicians in the OR to adult ICU transition without a team handoff reported significantly less information loss and better cooperation, despite positive interview data. A team handoff and supporting articulation work should increase awareness, improving quality and safety of care transitions.}

Outpatient polyclinics have a salient role in determining early outpatient treatments of COVID-19 to prevent hospitalization or death and reduce the burden on hospitals. However, they have not been widely investigated in the literature. The studies on spatial knowledge have identified environmental elements mainly related to vision with no focus on sound. Currently, there is limited research on the effect of sound environment on spatial knowledge acquisition in virtual outpatient polyclinics. In this study, a virtual simulated outpatient polyclinic has been created with varying levels of visual and audio cues. Eighty participants were assigned to one of the four groups: a control (no visual signage), a visual (visual signage), an only audio (no landmarks and no visual signage), and an audio-visual group. The virtual environment was presented as a video walkthrough with passive exploration to test spatial knowledge acquisition with tasks based on the landmark-route-survey model. The results showed that a combination of visual signage and sound environment resulted in higher spatial knowledge acquisition. No significant difference was found between the performance of the visual group and the control group that shows that signage alone cannot aid spatial knowledge in virtual outpatient polyclinics. Data from the only audio group suggests that landmarks associated with sound can compensate for the lack of visual landmarks that may help design a wayfinding system for users with visual disabilities.}

Exo-LiFFT, an extension of the Lifting Fatigue Failure Tool, is introduced as a means to unify the etiology of LBDs with the biomechanical function of exos. We present multiple examples demonstrating how Exo-LiFFT can assess or predict the effect of exos on LBD risk without costly, time-consuming electromyography studies. For instance, using simulated and real-world material handling data we show an exo providing a 30 Nm lumbar moment is projected to reduce cumulative back damage by ∼70% and LBD risk by ∼20%. Exo-LiFFT provides a practical, efficient ergonomic assessment tool to assist safety professionals exploring back exos as part of a comprehensive occupational health program.}

Workers most often traded-off workload, personal, and quality and safety pressures to accommodate system-level priorities. The Pressures Diagram was developed to visualise risk trade-offs and prioritising decisions and to facilitate communication about these aspects of healthcare work.}

Lower-limb joint proprioception was assessed by joint position sense errors measured at the ankle, knee and hip of the dominant side. Postural control during gait was characterized by step length, step width and local dynamic stability. Results showed that hip proprioception contributed the most to postural control during gait among the lower-limb joint proprioception components, and that mechanisms for the hip proprioception effects were different between age groups. These findings highlighted the importance of incorporating hip proprioception enhancement exercises in postural control training programs, and the necessity of considering age-related differences in the effects of hip proprioception when designing these exercises.}

Overall, bi- and trimodal warnings had faster response times for both age groups across driving conditions, but was more pronounced for older adults. Engagement in physical exercise was associated with smaller maximum braking force for younger participants only, and also corresponded to longer average fixation durations, compared to the non-exercise group.

If consumers are to safely handle such products, they need to be aware of the risks posed by the particular product they are using. Although most countries require that chemical household products feature warning labels (e.g. the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals), consumers appear to also use other cues to determine the risks associated with a specific product. Thus, we studied the influence of packaging on consumers' risk perception of chemical household products. More specifically, we examined the effect of the colour of the packaging (black or pink packaging versus the original packaging) as well as the presence of images of flowers or food-imitating elements on the packaging. Significant differences with regard to consumer's risk perception were found in terms of all four studied manipulations. Therefore, we conclude that consumers' risk perception can be influenced by the packaging design. In particular, if elements that lower consumer's risk perception (e.g. featuring flowers on the label and food-imitating elements on the packaging) are omitted from the packaging, consumers might be able to more accurately judge the risks associated with a product and so take appropriate safety precautions.}

Given that he is Chartered as both an Occupational Psychologist and an Ergonomist, it is not surprising that he has been concerned with the question of the reliability and validity of Ergonomics methods. In Occupational Psychology, psychometric and personnel selection methods are expected to exhibit acceptable levels of reliability, but this is an expectation which is still somewhat alien to Ergonomics. Neville's work has been instrumental in raising this issue and in providing approaches which can be used to critically evaluate the methods we use. We think that, despite his ground-breaking work, there is still much to do in the Ergonomics community to create the situation for which he has long argued.}
