abstract = {We investigated the learning of fine manual dexterity with a microsurgical instrument and a new simulator in a context of microsurgery. 30 subjects were divided into two groups. One (3D group) interacted with a stereoscopic and the other (2D group) with a monoscopic display. Visual information for the displays was captured from a surgical stereomicroscope. In 20 trials, both groups performed the repetitive tasks of picking up small rods from a funnel-shaped cavity and placing them outside. In analysing learning curves, we found that the initial learning process for hand-eye coordination is easier with a 3D display, and that performance persists at a higher level of proficiency than with the 2D display option. Thus stereoscopic displays can be especially beneficial for novices, for those learning new procedures, or for providing orientation to operators facing a new or altered spatial situation. Simulators with few reliefs or spatial textures should not be used for comparison between 3D and 2D viewing conditions.}

Therefore an experimental study was conducted to investigate the possibility of training non-professionals in the professional working methods and evaluation of relevant key criteria for drywall screwdrivers. 39 subjects were divided into three groups and trained in the professional use of a drywall screwdriver. Results indicate that targeted training significantly improves the professional way of working (professional hand position p = 0.000, β = -0.764) and evaluation (testing of mass distribution p = 0.000, β = -0.731) of a drywall screwdriver. The gained knowledge can be used for the implementation of objective usability test-environments to derive specific and differentiated user-centered development potentials under laboratory conditions.}

Many of these job-related tasks involve moving through environments, but existing literature examining camouflage effectiveness often assumes that movement effectively “breaks” even the best camouflage patterns, rendering them of limited utility for reducing the visual signature of a moving target. However, recent research demonstrates that animals equipped with adaptive camouflage change their patterning in predictable ways during movement and this adaptation decreases detectability, suggesting that uniform patterning may still hold value for reducing conspicuity during movement. The present experiment examined whether three visual pattern characteristics, local contrast, orientation, and spatial frequency, would influence the detectability of a moving human target. Participants attempted to detect and localize a simulated human target moving across a background scene, and a factorial design varied target movement speed, and the local contrast, spatial frequency, and orientation of its camouflage patterning. Results showed that target detectability was strongly influenced by target movement rate, pattern local contrast, and pattern spatial frequency, and these effects persisted even under conditions of very fast movement. Importantly, we found that the effect of local contrast was most robust under conditions of movement, suggesting its importance for reducing detectability of moving personnel. We conclude that movement is not always sufficient to break the concealment offered by a pattern with low contrast and a spatial frequency match with its background. Results are discussed in the context of visual processing theories and the application of these findings to the design and development of static and adaptive camouflage patterns for military personnel.}

ADs were found to affect upper limb postures in ADL, reducing the use of precision grasps in the right hand by 31.9% and increasing palm contact by 26% and 29.1% in right and left hands, respectively. Nevertheless, they were also found to increase shoulder flexion, elbow pronation and wrist deviation, which may be a drawback in some pathologies.

However, little is known about the factors that lead to drivers engaging in each behaviour. This article presents the findings from a study which collected and analysed data on the factors that lead to drivers engaging in each behaviour. The study involved a survey of drivers' perceptions of the causes of each behaviour and a subject matter expert workshop to gain the views of road safety experts. The results were mapped onto a systems ergonomics model of the road transport system in Queensland, Australia, to show where in the system the factors reside. In addition to well-known factors relating to drivers' knowledge, experience and personality, additional factors at the higher levels of the road transport system related to road safety policy, transport system design, road rules and regulations, and societal issues were identified. It is concluded that the fatal five behaviours have a web of interacting contributory factors underpinning them and are systems problems rather than driver-centric problems. The implications for road safety interventions are discussed.}

The first study required participants to use their own contemporary products in their homes in order to investigate older adults' familiarity with them, and how this familiarity differed from that of younger adults. Older people were less familiar with their own contemporary products that younger people. The second study aimed to investigate differences in familiarity between younger and older adults while using products that they did not own and were likely to be less familiar with. When using products not already familiar to them, both middle aged and older adults showed significantly lower familiarity than younger people. The significance of this research is in its empirical findings about familiarity differences between age groups. It has been recognised that the identification and understanding of differences in familiarity will enable designers to design more intuitive interfaces and systems for both younger and older cohorts. The implications of the findings from the two studies reported here are discussed in light of this recognition.}

abstract = {Safety is a constant priority for the railway industry and there are numerous hazards in and around the rail system which may result in damage to train and environment, human injury and fatalities. Low levels of human and organisational performance have been shown to be a prime cause of railway accidents and a number of accident models and methods have been developed in order to probe deeper into the role played by organisational factors in accident causation. The Systems–Theoretical Accident Modelling and Processes (STAMP) method for example, represents a promising systematic and systemic way of examining sociotechnical systems such as the railway. Another method, the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS), based upon Reason's model of human error in an organisational context, has also proved popular as a human factors accident analysis framework. However, human factors elements are still somewhat limited and under-specified and these managerial and social issues within an organisation are simply regarded as sources of failure in the control constraints of STAMP. HFACS likewise, categorises accident data rather than analysing it in more depth. In this context, a hybrid human and organisational analysis method based on HFACS-STAMP (HFACS-STAMP method for railway accidents, HS-RAs) is proposed to identify and analyse human and organisational factors involved in railway accidents. Using the categories of human errors derived from HFACS and the structured systematic analysis process of STAMP, the HS-RAs method provides a mechanism by which active failures can promulgate across organisations and give a systemic analysis of human error in accidents. Combined with human information processing, the HS-RAs method gives a detailed causal analysis of human errors from receiving information to implement control actions. At last, the HS-RAs method is demonstrated using a case study of the 2011 Yong-Wen railway collision. A number of prominent accident causes of human factors are revealed and necessary countermeasures are proposed to avoid the recurrence of similar accidents. The HFACS-STAMP hybrid method has several advantages and can contribute to railway safety by providing a detailed analysis of the role of human error in railway accidents.}

Nine men participated in an experiment carrying a hand load in four modes: one-handed right and left carry, and two-handed side and anterior carry, each at 50% and 75% of the participant's maximum acceptable weight of carry, and a no-load reference condition. Twelve gait parameters calculated from inertial sensor data for each gait cycle, including gait phase durations, torso and pelvis postural sway, and thoracic-pelvic coordination were used as predictors in a two-stage hierarchical random forest classification model with Bayesian inference. The model correctly classified 96.9% of the carrying modes and 93.1% of the load levels. Coronal thoracic-pelvic coordination and pelvis postural sway were the most relevant predictors although their relative importance differed between carrying mode and load level prediction models. This study presents an algorithmic framework for combining inertial sensing with statistical prediction with potential use for quantifying physical exposures from load carriage.}

abstract = {Background
Predicting the energy costs of human travel over snow can be of significant value to the military and other agencies planning work efforts when snow is present. The ability to quantify, and predict, those costs can help planners determine if snow will be a factor in the execution of dismounted tasks and operations. To adjust predictive models for the effect of terrain, and more specifically for surface conditions, on energy costs, terrain coefficients (ƞ) have been developed. The physiological demands of foot travel over snow have been studied previously, and there are well established methods of predicting metabolic costs of locomotion. By applying knowledge gained from prior studies of the effects of terrain and snow, and by leveraging those existing dismounted locomotion models, this paper seeks to outline the steps in developing an improved terrain coefficient (ƞ) for snow to be used in predictive modeling.
Methods
Using published data, methods, and a well-informed understanding of the physical elements of terrain, e.g., characterization of snow sinkage (z), this study made adjustments to ƞ-values specific to snow.
Results
This review of published metabolic cost methods suggest that an improved ƞ-value could be developed for use with the Pandolf equation, where z = depth (h)*(1 - (snow density (ρ0)/1.186)) and ƞ = 0.0005z3 + 0.0001z2 + 0.1072z + 1.2604.
Conclusion
While the complexity of variables related to characteristics of snow, speed of movement, and individuals confound efforts to develop a simple, predictive model, this paper provides data-driven improvements to models that are used to predict the energy costs of dismounted movements over snow.}

While research into the effectiveness of simulations as learning tools has found tangible benefits, fewer studies have examined retention and differences between high and low fidelity simulations. This research sought to supplement the literature in this domain by investigating whether participants who learned to construct an electrical circuit using a 2D or 3D breadboard simulation could achieve comparable learning, transfer, and retention outcomes to those who learned using a physical breadboard. The influence of learner characteristics - cognitive ability and goal orientation - were also evaluated. This study had two parts: a cross-sectional portion that examined learning and transfer outcomes and a longitudinal portion that examined retention outcomes after a 2 and 4-week period. The cross-sectional analysis included 70 participants and the longitudinal analysis included 40 participants. The results found that the physical fidelity of the learning environment significantly impacted several transfer outcomes (construction and construction time) but not retention outcomes. Cognitive ability was a significant predictor of learning (gain score, circuit design score) and retention (posttest scores, construction time) outcomes. Learning goal orientation significantly predicted circuit construction over time and measurement occasion significantly predicted posttest scores and interacted with fidelity to predict circuit design score. The study demonstrated that simulated environments can lead to comparable, or better, proficiency than physical environments. These findings have implications for the design and implementation of simulated environments, specifically for courses delivered in an online setting.}

In order to minimize experimental uncertainty due to well-known noise factors (i.e. patterns of discomfort during the work week and during the work day, order of evaluation, inter-individual differences), experimental trials were performed according to a crossover design. Statistical data analysis aimed mainly at investigating (dis-)comfort differences across seat conditions; gender-based differences in perceived discomfort on different body parts; effect of sitting duration on perceived discomfort on different body parts. The experimental results show that differences across seat conditions impacted differently on perceived discomfort depending on gender, body parts and sitting duration. No significant differences in perceived discomfort across gender were evident for the lightweight seat in both upright and reclined positions. On the contrary, for both baseline configurations, perceived discomfort at head and neck areas was higher for males than for females. For all seat conditions, participants experienced a significant worsening of perceived comfort over time at shoulders, back, sacrum and thighs and, in addition, at upper body area (i.e. neck, arm and forearm) and knees only for seats in reclined position.}

The testing environment consisted of a robotic platform that translated rapidly to destabilize participants, and a height-adjustable handrail that was mounted to the platform. Our findings support our hypotheses that starting position and handrail height significantly affect peak handrail forces in most axes. The highest handrail forces were applied when participants faced the handrail and grasped with two hands. In these cases, increased handrail height was associated with increased anterior forces and decreased downward, upward and resultant forces. As hypothesized, peak handrail forces correlated strongly with individual weight in most axes. Implications of these findings for handrail design are discussed.}

abstract = {Objective
To examine the role of cross-task cue utilisation in the acquisition of situational awareness during the initial stages of learning to operate an air traffic control simulation.
Background
Cue-based associations are an important component of situational awareness, a construct that is necessary for skilled process control, where the location, movement, and direction of multiple targets needs to be managed. However, the potential for high levels of situational awareness is difficult to assess in the absence of exposure. Previous research suggests that cross-task cue utilisation predicts the acquisition of feature-event associations that form the basis of situational awareness
Method
Sixty university students undertook an assessment of cue utilisation in the context of motor vehicle driving and subsequently engaged in an air traffic control simulation task. During the air traffic control simulation task, situational awareness queries were introduced based on the Situation Awareness Global Assessment Test (SAGAT).
Results
The analyses revealed that participants who demonstrated relatively higher levels of cross-task cue utilisation also demonstrated greater performance on the SAGAT and achieved greater performance during the simulated air traffic control task.
Conclusion
The outcomes suggest a relationship between cross-task cue utilisation and situational awareness, particularly at the initial stages of skill acquisition.
Application
Assessments of cross-task cue utilisation may be used to distinguish the propensity for prospective trainees to acquire the situational awareness necessary for complex, process control tasks such as air traffic control.}

The biomechanical and ergonomic impacts in 17 obese and 20 healthy-weight handlers were evaluated. The task studied consisted in moving boxes from a conveyor to a hand trolley and back. The results show that the anthropometric characteristics of obese handlers are linked to a significant increase in peak lumbar loading during lifting and lowering of boxes. Few postural differences between the two groups were observed. These results suggest that the excess weight of an obese worker has a significant added effect on the musculoskeletal structures of the back, which exposes obese handlers to a higher risk of developing a musculoskeletal disorder during load handling.}

Because of age related decline of the older driver's abilities, in-car warning signals may need adjustment to the older driver. We therefore investigated the effects of uni-, bi- and trimodal directional warnings (i.e., light, sound, vibration) on young and older drivers' responses in a driving simulator. A young group of 15 drivers (20–25 years of age) and an older group of 16 drivers (65–79 years of age) participated. In the simulations, warning signal was presented at the left, the center, or the right in front of the participant. With a warning at the left, the center, and the right the correct response was to steer to the right, brake, and steer to the left, respectively. The main results showed the older drivers' responses were slower for each type of warning compared with the young drivers' responses. Overall, the responses were slower with an added cognitively loading task. The only multimodal type of warning inducing overall faster response than its constituent warning types was the vibration-sound, and only for the older drivers. Additionally, with the groups' responses collapsed, such a true multimodal effect on response time also showed for the center vibration-sound warning (i.e., braking response). The only multimodal warning showing clear reduction in response errors compared with its constituent warning types was the vibration-sound for the older drivers during extra cognitive load. The main conclusion is that older drivers can benefit from bimodal warning, as compared with unimodal, in terms of faster and more accurate response. The potential superiority of trimodal warning is nevertheless argued.}

Anxiety was manipulated by competition, the presence of an evaluator, external video camera, and traffic noise. Most drivers showed greater anxiety scores and higher mean heart rates following manipulation. In both groups increased state anxiety decreased car speed control and caused more collisions, accompanied by fewer fixations of longer duration towards the driving lane across a horizontally narrower region. Inexperienced drivers increased the number of short fixations towards cars, while experienced drivers increased the number of short fixations on the speedometer. Although anxiety impairs processing efficiency and performance effectiveness for both groups, attentional changes differ as a function of experience. Inexperienced drivers tended to shift attention to threatening stimuli, while experienced drives were more likely to consciously monitor task goal.}

Subsequently, 12 nurses were asked to connect an infusion set to medical bottle in the form of manual and mechanical tasks and these tasks were evaluated using ergonomic indices including muscular activity level, force, posture, and subjective (Borg scale CR10) measures. Results showed that the activity levels (root mean square) of the extensor digitorum communis, flexor carpi radialis, biceps, triceps, and deltoid muscles remarkably decreased when the nurses used the ISCT. The postures of the wrist, arm, and shoulder regions were corrected from Rapid Upper Limb Assessment action level 3 to 2 when the designed tool was used.

abstract = {Introduction
As sports systems become increasingly more complex, competitive, and technology-centric, there is a greater need for systems ergonomics methods to consider the performance, health, and safety of athletes in context with the wider settings in which they operate. Therefore, the purpose of this systematic review was to identify and critically evaluate studies which have applied a systems ergonomics research approach in the context of sports performance and injury management.
Material and methods
Five databases (PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, and SPORTDiscus) were searched for the dates 01 January 1990 to 01 August 2017, inclusive, for original peer-reviewed journal articles and conference papers. Reported analyses were underpinned by a recognised systems ergonomics method, and study aims were related to the optimisation of sports performance (e.g. communication, playing style, technique, tactics, or equipment), and/or the management of sports injury (i.e. identification, prevention, or treatment).
Results
A total of seven articles were identified. Two articles were focussed on understanding and optimising sports performance, whereas five examined sports injury management. The methods used were the Event Analysis of Systemic Teamwork, Cognitive Work Analysis (the Work Domain Analysis Abstraction Hierarchy), Rasmussen's Risk Management Framework, and the Systems Theoretic Accident Model and Processes method. The individual sport application was distance running, whereas the team sports contexts examined were cycling, football, Australian Football League, and rugby union.
Conclusions
The included systems ergonomics applications were highly flexible, covering both amateur and elite sports contexts. The studies were rated as valuable, providing descriptions of injury controls and causation, the factors influencing injury management, the allocation of responsibilities for injury prevention, as well as the factors and their interactions underpinning sports performance. Implications and future directions for research are described.}

abstract = {During collaborative problem solving (CPS), coordination occurs at different spatial and temporal scales. This multiscale coordination should play a functional role in facilitating effective collaboration. To evaluate this, we conducted a study of computer-based CPS with 42 dyadic teams. We used cross-wavelet coherence to examine movement coordination, extracted from videos, at several scales, and tested whether the observed coordination was greater than expected due to chance and due to task demands. We found that coordination at scales less than 2s was greater than chance and at most scales (except 16s, 1m, and 2m), was greater than expected due to task demands. Lastly, we observed that coherence at .25s and 1s scales was predictive of performance. However, when including relative phase, our results suggest that higher in-phase movement coordination at the 1s scale was the strongest predictor of CPS performance. Further, we used growth curve modeling to examine how movement coordination changes across the duration of the task and whether this is moderated by CPS performance. We found that coordination over the duration of the CPS task is quadratic (a U shape) and that better performing teams have higher coordination with a shallower curve. We discuss these findings and their relevance to understanding how low-level movement coordination facilitates CPS.}

Novice chart-users completed a series of experimental trials in which they viewed patient data presented on one of three observation chart designs (varied within-subjects), and indicated which observation was abnormal (or that none were). A chart that incorporated both graphically displayed observations and an integrated colour-based scoring-system yielded faster, more accurate responses and fewer, shorter fixations than a graphical chart without a colour-based scoring-system. The latter, in turn, yielded the same advantages over a tabular chart (which incorporated neither design feature).

The musculus deltoideus was significantly relieved after the elevation of the shoulder belt for subjects with an initial attachment height of 2 cm below the shoulder. The musculus trapezius was relieved with the elevation above the shoulder. At a height of more than 2 cm above the shoulder, no further muscle unloading was achieved. These findings prove that a height adjustment can provide a systematic unloading or deloading of the shoulder musculature. Despite the fact that the magnitude and direction of changes in muscle activity lead to rather individual responses, the intra-individual responses are consistent. Therefore, support systems should provide the range of individual requirements.}

The participants walked a prescribed course at a “slow”, “normal”, and “fast” pace. With both shoe types, there were significant reductions in tibial shock values when insoles were used. With the work boots, the dynamic insole further reduced tibial shock relative to the static insole. The significant interactions show that the differences between insole conditions become greater with faster walking speeds.}

However, at present these skills cannot be formally shared with other workers or used to develop and implement new solutions or assistive technologies because they involve a high level of tacit knowledge which only exists in skilled operators' internal cognitions. Industry needs reliable methods for the capture and analysis of this tacit knowledge so that it can be shared and not lost but also so that it can be best utilised in the transfer of manual work to automated systems and introduction of new technologies and processes. This paper describes two UK manufacturing case studies that applied systematic task analysis methods to capture and scrutinise the tacit knowledge and skills being applied in the visual inspection of aerospace components. Results reveal that the method was effective in eliciting tacit knowledge, and showed that tacit skills are particularly needed when visual inspection standards lack specification or the task requires greater subjective interpretation. The implications of these findings for future research and for developments in the manufacturing industry are discussed.}

abstract = {Surgeons work in awkward work postures and have high precision demands - well-known risk factors for musculoskeletal pain. Robotic-assisted laparoscopy is expected to be less demanding compared to conventional laparoscopy; however, studies indicate that robotic-assisted laparoscopy is also associated with poor ergonomics and musculoskeletal pain. The ergonomic condition in the robotic console is partially dependent upon the chair provided, which often is a regular office chair. Our study quantified and compared the muscular load during robotic-assisted laparoscopy using one of two custom built ergonomic chairs and a regular office chair. The results demonstrated no differences that could be considered clinically relevant. Overall, the study showed high levels of static and mean muscular activity, increased perceived physical exertion from pre-to-post surgery, and moderate to high risk for musculoskeletal injuries measured by the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment worksheet. Authors advocate for further investigation in surgeons’ ergonomics and physical work demands in robotic surgery.}

With 18 subjects sitting on a rigid seat and two foam cushions, SEAT values were measured objectively (from the transmitted vibration), measured subjectively (by the responses of subjects), and predicted (using a model of the seat-passenger system). Except with high magnitude low frequency shocks, predicted SEAT values were similar to measured SEAT values. With shocks causing subjects to rise off a cushion and subsequently impact the cushion (low frequencies around 1 g), subjective SEAT values were better estimated using predicted SEAT values than objectively measured SEAT values, because accelerometers on cushions exaggerated the impact of the falling subject. However, accelerometers on rigid seats will underestimate such impacts.}

These exit signs are often found in the presence of other colored signs, which may distract occupants when searching for safe exits. Such distractions can lead to confusing and even harmful outcomes, especially if occupants misinterpret the sign colors, mistaking non-exit signs for exit signs. We studied which colored signs people were most likely to infer were exit signs in a simulated emergency evacuation using virtual reality (VR). Participants were immersed in a virtual room with two doors (left and right), and an illuminated sign with different colored vertical bars above each door. They saw all pairwise combinations of six sign colors across trials. On each trial, a fire alarm sounded, and participants walked to the door that they thought was the exit. We tested two hypotheses: a local exposure hypothesis that color inferences are determined by exit sign colors in the local environment (i.e., red) and a semantic association hypothesis that color inferences are determined by color-concept associations (i.e. green associated with “go” and “safety”). The results challenged the local exposure hypothesis and supported the semantic association hypothesis. Participants predominantly walked toward green signs, even though the exit signs in the local environment—including the building where the experiment took place—were red. However, in a post-experiment survey, most participants reported that exit signs should be red. The results demonstrated a dissociation between the way observers thought they would behave in emergency situations (red = exit) and the way they did behave in simulated emergencies (green = exit). These findings have implications for the design of evacuation systems. Observers, and perhaps designers, do not always anticipate how occupants will behave in emergency situations, which emphasizes the importance of behavioral evaluations for egress safety.}

This top-down approach starts with a work domain model in order to analyze and specify contexts of activity. To complement this method, we propose a bottom-up version of Cognitive Work Analysis focusing on contexts of activity and depicting how operators adapt to the ecological constraints. Based on Rasmussen's Dynamic Safety Model, the ecological constraints involved are those bounding the workspace in which operators dynamically navigate with control loops, strategies, work organization, and competencies. This analysis relies on the simulation of specific contexts of activity. A first illustrative application of this framework to a simulated medical emergency situation with a team of nurses and nursing aids shows that this framework can help identify design issues.}

Robot-assisted surgery (RAS), a new surgical technology, can lead to new challenges in communication owing to the remote location of the surgeon away from the patient and bedside assistants. Nevertheless, few studies have studied communication strategies during RAS. In this study, 11 robot-assisted radical prostatectomies were recorded and the interaction events between the surgeon and two bedside surgical team members were categorized by modality (verbal/nonverbal), topic, and pair (sender and receiver). Both verbal and nonverbal modalities were used by all pairs. The percentage of nonverbal interactions differed significantly by pair: 66% for the Surgeon-Physician Assistant, 50% for the Physician Assistant-Scrub Nurse, and 25% for the Surgeon-Scrub Nurse, indicating different communication strategies across pairs. In addition, there was a significant dependence between topic and the percentages of verbal and nonverbal events for all pairs. Strategies to improve team communication during RAS should take into account the use of verbal and nonverbal communication means and the variation in interaction strategies based on the topic of communication.}

Participants (n = 38) were recruited to explore the simulation and evaluate the workplace dimensions represented. A comparison between the scores participants attributed to the work dimensions and the scores assigned by the ergonomics consultant was performed through a statistical test to verify whether they significantly differed or not. Out of the 10 aspects evaluated, only 3 presented significant differences, thus showing that GE suitability for ergonomics analysis is conditioned to the aspects represented. Qualitative data analysis highlighted participants' perception of GEs potential as an analysis and educational tool, as well as a medium for fostering communication and stakeholder involvement in the design process.}

In the first, thirty-one professional players are observed in order to account for typical forms of behaviour in relation to certain specific sets of game situations. Two characteristic populations are distinguished. The second study uses observations and self-confrontation interviews with twelve players representative of each population in order to characterise their situation assessment. Results highlight important contrasts between the two populations, both in behaviour and in situation assessment. They suggest that one norm of activity centred on the rally-ending issue and another on the roles to be assumed, guide the specific coherency of these populations under time pressure. The identification of these norms provides a hypothesis concerning the foundations of sensemaking. Implications for training development are discussed.}

Established communication methods, such as eye-contact between pedestrians and drivers, may no longer work when automated vehicles represent the interaction partner. Therefore, we evaluated several human-machine-interfaces (HMI) in order to implement smooth and comfortable communication. We conducted a two-stage study consisting of an explorative focus group discussion with naïve pedestrians (n = 6), followed by an experimental video simulation study (n = 25) based on the results of the focus group discussion. From the focus group we sought member opinion about various HMI, upon presentation of acoustic and visual communication systems such as projections, displays and LED light strips, in addition to portable communication systems, specifically smart watches. On the basis of the focus group discussion, an evaluation criteria was derived. For the video simulation study, HMI designs were created with variations in position, type and coding of the message, and technology. These were assessed by 25 subjects according to the focus discussion derived evaluation criteria: recognizability, unambiguousness, interaction comfort and intuitive comprehensibility. The results show that direct instructions to cross the street are preferred over status information of the vehicle and that large-scale text-based messages from the vehicle to the pedestrian, deliver better results. Design recommendations for HMIs for communication between automated vehicles are derived, and the extent external HMIs may supplement informal communication strategies such as vehicle movement or braking maneuvers, is discussed.}

Discomfort tends to increase when passengers are unable to perform desired activities (eg: reading, sleeping), which causes irritation and disappointment.

In order to support these tasks effectively and efficiently, landmark pictograms also need to be salient, as the map user needs to identify and process them quickly and easily. Two additional relevant characteristics for the usability of landmark pictograms are their meaningfulness and recognition performance. Meaningfulness is required to understand which categories of objects are represented by the pictograms. Ease of recognition prevents the necessity to consult a map repetitively and may support the formation of a cognitive map of the environment. In the present study, we investigated the relation between salience, meaningfulness and recognition performance of OpenStreetMap (OSM) pictograms and the potential effects of the visual complexity of pictograms on these usability characteristics. Salience was measured via eye fixations on specific pictograms, meaningfulness with an explicit continuous scale and recognition performance with a yes/no recognition memory paradigm. Statistical analyses showed that pictograms drew more visual attention if they were visually complex or if their meaning was inapprehensible or ambiguous. Less apprehensible pictograms were also recognized more often. Interestingly, the data indicated that longer fixations could lead to worse recognition performance. Long fixations on a pictogram may increase the likelihood of false recognition in subsequent situations where the pictogram is no longer valid or relevant. Based on the findings, we suggest balancing the meaningfulness and visual complexity of contiguous pictograms to enhance their recognition and to provide an optimal level of salience of single objects.}

This study evaluated the CNs' work patterns and flow disruptions (FD) by analyzing 25 surgeries across three different ORs. The OR layouts were divided into transitional and functional zones, and the work of CNs was categorized into patient, equipment, material, and information tasks. The results reveal that information tasks involve less movement than other types of work, while across all ORs, CNs were more likely to be involved in layout and environmental hazard FDs when involved in patient, material, or equipment-related tasks compared to information tasks. Different CN work patterns and flow disruptions between ORs suggest a link between OR layout and a CN's work. Future studies should examine how specific layout elements influence outcomes.}

We measured muscle activity in 13 muscles in the shoulder and trunk, and captured full body kinematics while participants completed simulated, repetitive work tasks. Every 12 min, reference data were collected to quantify fatigue. This sequence continued until they reached the termination criteria. Participants displayed significant signs of muscle fatigue, loss of strength and increased perceived fatigue (p < 0.05). Analysis revealed a significant effect of time on posture and muscle activity that was both task and time dependent, and variable both between and within individuals.

abstract = {Increasing concerns about musculoskeletal disorders in the upper back arising from excessive daily use of the smartwatch have been widely validated by the rising prevalence of discomfort. This study explored the smartwatch as a potential ergonomic intervention over the smartphone. Fourteen healthy participants completed five tasks (application setting, calling, message typing, message checking and vocal message entry) with smartphone and smartwatch in both sitting and standing postures. The neck-shoulder kinematics and muscle activation levels were monitored to assess the effects of the tasks, devices, and postures. The results indicated greater head flexion, head rotation and shoulder abduction and greater muscle activities for smartwatch use compared to smartphone use, but the performance measure (i.e., elapsed time) was superior for smartwatch use in all tasks except message typing. Collectively, only short and simple tasks such as message checking and application setting should be conducted with the smartwatch.}

For each of 28 paper mill workers, postures and movements were assessed during three full shifts using inclinometer registration and observation from video. Summary metrics for each shift, e.g., 10th, 50th, and 90th posture percentile, were averaged across shifts and across workers. In addition, the standard deviation between workers, and the standard deviation between shifts within worker were computed. The results showed that trunk and arm postures during paper mill work were similar to other occupations involving manual materials handling, but the velocities of arm movements were lower. While postures determined by inclinometry and observation were similar on a group level, substantial differences were found between results obtained by the two methods for individual workers, particularly for extreme postures. Thus, measurements by either method on individuals or small groups should be interpreted with caution.}

The Quick Exposure Check (QEC) was designed to assess exposure to work-related musculoskeletal risk factors affecting the back, shoulder/arm, wrist/hand, and neck. We investigated the inter-rater reliability of the summary scores and individual items of the QEC by comparing two simultaneous assessments of 51 work tasks, performed by 14 different workers. The work tasks were mainly “light” to “moderately heavy”. For total scores, the level of disagreement for shoulder/arm had a Relative Position of 0.13 (95% CI: 0.02; 0.23) and no statistically significant random disagreement. Percentage agreement was 63–100% for individual items and 71–88% for total score. Weighted Kappa of agreement for the individual items rated by the assessors were −0.94–0.77; highest for back motion, and lowest for wrist/hand position. The Swedish translation of the Quick Exposure Check has moderate to very good inter-rater reliability with fair to slight levels of systematic disagreement. There was no statistically significant random disagreement.}

Within a proposed UX evaluation framework, the perceived UX quality relative to VR glasses hardware emerged as a core predictor in predicting interactive operation performance, whereas the application UX perception was a significant predictor of motion sickness.}

Sixteen gender-balanced participants completed the simulated job in all combinations of two HWD types (binocular vs. monocular) and four UIs, the latter of which manipulated information mode (text-vs. graphic-based) and information availability (always-on vs. on-demand); a baseline condition was also completed (paper pick list). Job performance, workload, and usability were more affected by UI designs than HWD type. For example, the graphic-based UI reduced job completion time and number of errors by ∼13% and ∼59%, respectively. Participants had no strong preference for either of the HWD types, suggesting that the physical HWD designs tested are suboptimal.}

Such data are useful for characterizing job-level exposures and, when coupled with task-level information, can inform interventions to mitigate high-exposure tasks. Previously reported methods for capturing task-level information, however, were limited primarily to self-report diaries or direct observation. In this study of machine-paced manufacturing workers (n=6), a low-cost radio frequency identification (RFID) system was used to collect information about when, and for how long, specific assembly tasks were performed during up to 14 consecutive work shifts (76 total work shifts across the six participants). The RFID data were compared to information collected with a self-report diary using Bland-Altman analyses. In addition, the RFID data were paired with IMU data to identify task-level exposures from within full-shift recordings of upper arm postures and movements. These data were then used to estimate the relative contributions of between- and within-worker sources of variance to overall variance in posture and movement summary measures using hierarchical random-effects analysis of variance (ANOVA) techniques. Average estimates of daily task duration based on RFID data were comparable to estimates obtained by self-report (mean bias < ±1 minute) but with substantial variability (limits of agreement > ±100 minutes). In addition, the ANOVA models containing task-level information suggested a substantial amount of the overall exposure variance was attributed to repeated observations of the same task within a work day. These findings (i) suggest that while the RFID system used in this study performed adequately, further refinement, validation, and/or alternative strategies may be needed and (ii) underscore the importance of repeated full-shift and task-based measurement approaches in characterizing physical exposures, even in machine-paced environments.}

The relationship between knowledge components and knowledge acquisition processes, as well as fuel efficiency, were examined. Structural equation modelling results indicated that perceived strategy knowledge was related to acquisition by testing (i.e., interacting with the vehicle and its interfaces) and reading (i.e., manuals, books and websites) while technical system knowledge was only related to acquisition by reading. In contrast to technical system knowledge, perceived strategy knowledge was no significant predictor of fuel efficiency. The results indicated that emphasis should be put into promoting technical system knowledge (e.g., by tutoring systems) to support motivated drivers' in achieving higher fuel efficiency.}

By translating these bottlenecks as possibilities for improvement, solutions were designed for the airport and aircraft interiors to reduce boarding time and improve the passenger boarding experience. Concepts ranged from an app to scan your hand luggage at home and make a reservation for overhead bin space; to a redesigned waiting area to help passengers prepare for boarding; to new boarding methods and redesigned aircraft seats.

The aim of the present study was to utilise a systems thinking approach to explore the perceived responsibilities for identifying and treating concussion held by different actors across the community rugby system (e.g., players, coaches, parents, medics, referees, and management), as well as their role-specific concussion management strategies.
Methods
A systems approach was taken to assess what different stakeholders within rugby systems perceive their roles to be regarding concussion identification and treatment. Through an online survey, 118 members of the amateur (community) rugby union system were asked about their role-specific concussion management responsibilities and strategies. Respondents included players, parents, medics, coaches, club managers, administrators, and volunteers.
Results
The majority of respondents indicated that they were able to identify the symptoms of rugby-related concussion, however, only medics stated their responsibility to use formal concussion assessments (e.g., SCAT2). A smaller number of the respondents indicated that they were involved in treating concussion within their current role/s (majority of which were medics).
Conclusions
This study illustrated that the current challenges in the identification and treatment of rugby-related concussion in community sport may be due to role/responsibility confusion and possible overreliance on field-side medics. These findings offer insight into the possible limitations of the current concussion management guidelines and may offer empirically based direction for future revisions.}

Overall, the results showed no differences between field and lab-based testing under favourable operational conditions. However, under difficult operational conditions (i.e. dual task demands, poor product usability) differences between field and lab-based testing emerged (corresponding to small and medium effect sizes).

Therefore, link-segment biomechanical modeling was applied for 18 participants during three sagittal 4.3 lifts/minute tasks at chosen MAWL levels. Each lift produced unique kinematics, kinetics, MAWL loads and most highly stressed joints. Lifting from the lowest starting position most heavily challenged the L5/S1 joint, whereas more upright starting postures stressed the shoulder. Lifting loads above and below MAWL level demonstrated consistent joint loading patterns. The normalized peak moments of the highest stressed joint were similar across the lifts at ∼70–75% of the joint maximum. Our results suggest that MAWLs may be chosen based on perception of the most stressed joint for the specific lift.}

The results showed that easy-to-read language (compared to conventional language) led to improvements for some performance measures (e.g., recognition of content) but also to increased reading time, decreased text liking and reduced intention to revisit the web site. This article concludes that when implementing easy-to-read language in web sites, adverse as well as beneficial effects on nondisabled users need to be considered.}

Ten male subjects lifted a box from multiple lift origins (combinations of vertical height and asymmetry) to a common destination using a squatting lifting technique with and without the use of either exoskeleton. Dependent measures included subject kinematics, moment arms between the torso or weight being lifted and the lumbar spine, and spinal loads as predicted by an electromyography-driven spine model. One of the exoskeletons tested (StrongArm Technologies™ FLx) reduced peak torso flexion at the shin lift origin, but differences in moment arms or spinal loads attributable to either of the interventions were not observed. Thus, industrial exoskeletons designed to control posture may not be beneficial in reducing biomechanical loads on the lumbar spine. Interventions altering the external manual materials handling environment (lift origin, load weight) may be more appropriate when implementation is fesible.}

Overall, results showed that pre-activating prior topic knowledge increased the time spent evaluating the search engine results pages, fostered deeper processing of the navigational paths elaborated (and thus reduced the exploration of different navigational paths) and improved the semantic specificity of queries. Pre-activating prior knowledge helped older adults produced semantically more specific queries when they had lower prior-knowledge than young adults. Moderation analyses indicated that the pre-activation supported older adults' search performance under the condition that participants generated semantically relevant keywords during this pre-activation task. Implications of these results show that prior topic knowledge pre-activation may be a good lead to support the beneficial role of prior knowledge in older users’ search behavior and performance.

We determined the percentage and frequency of instrument use and limb actions throughout the total laparoscopic surgical duration, as well as the duration of instrument inactivity. Seven instruments and seven actions were studied across nine surgical procedures. Manoeuvring, blunt dissection, and tenting up tissues accounted for the longest amount of total surgical time (non-dominant hand (NDH) 29%, dominant hand (DH) 39%), followed by grasping (NDH 33%, DH 9%), and cauterising (NDH <0.2%, DH 8%). Least time was spent performing other actions such as suction/irrigation (NDH 0.01%, DH 3%) and stapling colorectal tissue (NDH 0.03%, DH 0.5%). The total duration of instrument use and hand actions by the dominant and non-dominant hands were similar overall. However, the frequency of actions performed was lower for the non-dominant hand. This indicates that the non-dominant hand spent more time holding actions than switching between actions, supporting the actions of the dominant hand. These findings highlight the lengthy durations of laparoscopic surgical procedures involved in navigating to anatomical planes and moving tissues. Further, the results detail the extent of secondary functions performed with the surgical instruments.}

abstract = {Cranking the landing gear is a common task performed by truck drivers to raise or lower trailers. This task poses a risk to the shoulder joint due to the required forceful exertion and the posture constrained to the hand-handle interface. As a potential occupational risk, there has been no definitive guideline for best practices among truck drivers. An operator can crank perpendicular (frontal) or parallel (sagittal) to the crank rotation. In this laboratory study, the effects of cranking method and resistance on scapular range of motion and shoulder muscle activity were observed in 12 participants. Scapular posture was measured using an optical motion tracking system. EMG was monitored on 16 muscles contributing to shoulder movement. The results show that during frontal cranking, the scapular range of protraction was 28 ± 11.6°, which was more than the sagittal cranking (23 ± 10.4°), indicating a decreased subacromial space and elevated shoulder impingement risk. Seven muscles (all three deltoid muscles, middle trapezius, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor) demonstrated that when the crank resistance was low, the front cranking method resulted in lower activity than the side cranking. When the crank resistance was 20 Nm, the muscle activity on these seven muscles was greater when cranking from the front than from the side. Based on these observations, we suggest that when the resistance is low (lowering the trailer) the driver should stand facing the trailer. On the contrary, it is advantageous to stand parallel to the trailer and crank while raising the trailer to apply the full body strength to reduce the shoulder load.}

Workflow disruptions were not compared with other surgeries; however, the prevalence of equipment and training disruptions differs from other types of surgeries. A consistent observation is that communication and coordination problems are relatively frequent, suggesting that the surgical team may need to be trained to use specific verbal and non-verbal cues during surgery. RAS also changes the necessary size of the operating room instrument cleaning processes. These studies demonstrate the value of clinically-based human factors engineers working alongside surgical teams to improve the delivery of RAS.}

During the typing sessions, we measured typing force; muscle activity in extrinsic finger muscles (flexor digitorum superficialis and extensor digitorum communis), shoulder (trapezius) and neck (splenius capitis); wrist posture; typing performance; and self-reported comfort/preference. While using the ultra-low travel keyboards, subjects typed with less force and wrist extension, and had more ulnar deviation (p's < 0.0001) compared with conventional keyboard. However, these differences in typing forces were less than 0.5 N and less than 4° for both wrist extension and ulnar deviation. The general trend of data did not show any consistent or substantial differences in muscle activity (less than 2 %MVC) and typing performance (<5 WPM in speed; < 3% in accuracy), despite the observed statistical difference in the finger flexors and extensors muscle activity (p's < 0.19) and typing performance (p < 0.0001). However, the subjects preferred using conventional keyboards in most of the investigated self-reported comfort and preference criteria (p's < 0.4). In conclusion, these small differences indicate that using ultra-low travel keyboards may not have substantial differences in biomechanical exposures and typing performance compared to conventional keyboard; however, the subjective responses indicated that the ultra-low keyboards with the shortest key travel tended to be the least preferred.}

abstract = {Objectives
Both pneumatic rock drills and electric rotary hammer drills are used for drilling large holes (e.g., 10–20 mm diameter) into concrete for structural upgrades to buildings, highways, bridges, and airport tarmacs. However, little is known about the differences in productivity, and exposures to noise, handle vibration, and dust between the two types of drills. The aim of this study was to compare these outcomes with similar mass electric rotary and pneumatic rock drills drilling into concrete block on a test bench system.
Method
Three experiments were conducted on a test bench system to compare an electric (8.3 kg) and pneumatic drill (8.6 kg) on (1) noise and handle vibration, (2) respirable silica dust, and (3) drilling productivity. The test bench system repeatedly drilled 19 mm diameter x 100 mm depth holes into cured concrete block while the respective exposure levels were measured following ISO standards.
Results
Productivity levels were similar between the electric and the pneumatic drill (9.09 mm/s vs. 8.69 mm/s ROP; p = 0.15). However, peak noise (LPeak: 117.7 vs. 139.4 dBC; p = 0.001), weighted total handle vibration (ahw: 7.15 vs. 39.14 m/s2; p = 0.002), and respirable silica dust levels (0.55 vs. 22.23 mg/m3; p = 0.003) were significantly lower for the electric than the pneumatic drill.
Discussion
While there were no differences in drilling productivity between an electric and pneumatic drill of similar mass, there were substantial differences in exposure levels of noise, handle vibration, and respirable silica dust. Structural contractors should switch from pneumatic rock drills to electric rotary hammer drills for structural drilling into concrete in order to reduce worker exposures to the hazards of noise, hand vibration, and silica dust.}

In the Kansei design method, it is important to select affective variables related to the design elements of the product in order to accurately grasp the emotions of customers. Therefore, this study seeks to develop an affective variable extraction methodology that can reflect users' implicit needs effectively and efficiently. In this study, users' affective variables were extracted from online reviews and classified using a self-organizing map (SOM). For verification, the study selected the Amazon e-commerce service and performed a product experiment on recliners. The experimental results show that the most frequently used affective variable in the use of recliners is ‘comfort’, which is related to various affective variables. In addition, 15 clusters for affective experiences of recliners extracted from Amazon.com were classified through the SOM. The findings suggest that text mining techniques and the SOM can be used to gather and analyze customers' affective experiences effectively and efficiently.

Compare the effectiveness of light, medium and heavy weight Police expandable batons from a performance and a user perception perspective.
Rationale
Police Officers are required to control combative individuals using less lethal tactics in proportion to the threat they face. Officers need to deliver sufficient force quickly and accurately. As such, it is important to select batons that are optimal for both performance and user experience.
Methods
Eleven active-duty New York Police Department Officers completed static and dynamic strike testing followed by a questionnaire. Six baton types were tested using different weights and lengths.
Results
Peak force, dynamic task speed and accuracy were similar between baton types. Peak impulse, forearm muscle activity, and discomfort were higher with the heaviest baton.
Conclusions
Lighter batons can deliver sufficient force to control assailants while imposing lower ergonomic costs and being preferable to the user with no impact on speed or accuracy.}

abstract = {Working conditions of residential roofers expose them to a unique sloped environment. The purpose of this study is to determine in what way traversing across a sloped/roof surface alters lower extremity kinematics of the upslope and downslope legs compared to level walking. College aged males negotiated across a pitched (26 degrees) roof segment during which lower extremity three-dimensional kinematics were calculated. One foot was higher on the slope and one was lower for the duration of cross slope walking. Overall, cross-slope walking on a 26 degree roof significantly altered 77% of the measured lower extremity variables compared to level self-selected pace walking. The data suggest that roof pitch incite significant differences in crossslope walking of the kinematics in the lower extremity between the upslope and down slope limbs when compared to level surface walking. These alterations could temporarily alter proprioception which may in turn lead to increased falls and musculoskeletal injury, though further study is needed.}

An index to assess the overall risk of patient transfers was created; it makes it possible to quantify risk based on the patient's position and the height of the patient's location. An analysis of 71 transfers executed by paramedics in actual work situations showed that moving a patient from the ground was characterized by acute sagittal flexions and axial rotations, respectively, 42% and 12% of the time. When the patient was lying on a raised surface, the lifting index and perceived exertion were the lowest (2.55; easy). According to the overall risk index, patient transfers from the ground are the riskiest. Paramedics execute many risky lifts even in favorable patient handling contexts.}

Recent Australian research on workplace risk management practices in 19 work organisations found that risks from work-related psychosocial hazards were poorly managed. This study identified factors impeding better management of MSD and MHD risks within those organisations.
Method
Interviews were conducted with staff from residential aged care and logistics/transport organisations in Australia. Transcripts were analysed using a worker-centred systems framework.
Results and conclusions
Many barriers to more effective risk management were identified. Most fundamentally, few people knew of the need to manage MSD risk arising from work-related psychosocial hazards, and OHS-related skills of key managers were often reported as inadequate, particularly concerning management of risk from psychosocial hazards. Also, funding and staffing levels were often reported as problematic, and OHS issues were seen as lower priority than accreditation and commercial requirements.}

Neck, trunk, and upper arm postures (means and minute-to-minute variances) were determined during periods of sitting and standing from 24 office workers using sit-stand tables to perform computer work. Posture variability resulting from different temporal compositions of sitting and standing computer work was then predicted for the neck, trunk and upper arm by simulations. Postural variability during computer work could be increased up to three-fold when 20–60% of the work was performed standing (i.e. 40–80% performed sitting), compared to performing computer work only sitting. The exact composition of sit-stand proportions leading to maximum variability, as well as the potential size of the increase in variability, differed considerably between workers. Guidelines for sit-stand table use should note these large inter-individual differences.}

However, the engineering design of sports gloves in relation to hand anthropometry measurements remains unclear. In this study, two types of ready-to-wear sport gloves, namely, war-gaming glove and hiking glove were purchased from the market. The glove dimensions, fabrication properties and the effect of glove fit on hand and finger dexterity were investigated. Thirty female individuals (20–29 years old) participated a series of hand performance tests and subjective perception rating assessments towards the gloves. Results indicated that the active range of motion of fingers, finger tactile sensitivity, gripping strength and ability to handle pegs and marbles decreased with the use of gloves compared with bare hands. The perceptions of comfort and ease of hand motions decreased with the increased of wear time. The glove fit in terms of finger length dimensions was significantly correlated with hand grip force. The glove fit in hand, wrist and finger circumference dimensions had significant impact on the ability to handle small objects. It is suggested that hand length, hand circumference, finger circumference and the ratio of finger length to palm length should be considered in the design and development of gloves to improve hand performance and comfort.}

However, ergonomic models incorporating personal characteristics into a comprehensive model are lacking. This study explores the utility of adding personal characteristics such as the estimated L5/S1 Intervertebral Disc (IVD) cross-sectional area, age, gender and Body Mass Index to the Revised NIOSH Lifting Equation (RNLE) with the goal to improve risk assessment. A dataset with known RNLE Cumulative Lifting Indices (CLIs) and related health outcomes was used to evaluate the impact of personal characteristics on RNLE performance. The dataset included 29 cases and 101 controls selected from a cohort of 1022 subjects performing 667 jobs. RNLE risk assessment was improved by incorporation of personal characteristics. Adding gender and intervertebral disc size multipliers to the RNLE raised the odds ratio for a CLI of 3.0 from 6.71 (CI: 2.2–20.9) to 24.75 (CI: 2.8–215.4). Similarly, performance was either unchanged or improved when some existing multipliers were removed. The most promising RNLE change involved incorporation of a multiplier based on the estimated IVD cross-sectional area (CSA). Results are promising, but confidence intervals are broad and additional, prospective research is warranted to validate findings.}

abstract = {The aim of this work is to define a new method that helps researchers to analyze perceptions of (dis)comfort in dynamic conditions. Recent studies pay considerable attention to body movements, mobility, and stability to measure comfort or discomfort when seated. Most of these discuss the relations between subjective comfort/discomfort and objective measurements (e.g. body pressure distribution, body movement and EMG) for short- and medium-term sitting. The present analysis took place in a classroom of the Industrial Engineering Department at the University of Salerno. The participants included 25 students (12 females and 13 males), who were observed during classroom hours. The students were invited to sit at a combo-desk and were free to perform different combinations of movements while writing and listening. These activities required that they adapt their body movements, as the combo-desk was fixed to the floor. A pressure pad was used to detect pressure at interface and center of pressure's changes, allowing for the bodies' motion data to be recorded. The aim was to identify the correct threshold to be used for movement detection and to investigate correlations between the number of movements and the perceived (dis)comfort. The study also identifies those body parts that have the greatest effect on (dis)comfort perception.}

Results showed cognitive performance on the psychomotor vigilance task declined when participants were dehydrated in the heat and Stroop task performance was impaired when dehydrated late in the afternoon. Firefighters may be at risk of deteriorations in simple cognitive functions in the heat whilst dehydrated, although may also experience impairments in complex cognitive functions if dehydrated late in the day, irrespective of the environmental temperature.}

Our objective was to simulate the performance of a production line balanced against physical overload by the addition of an extra workstation. Based on ergonomic work analysis, the study applied System Dynamics at the global observation stage to obtain a systemic interpretation of the factors involved in production line performance. According to the indicators, the alternative configuration reduced physical overload by 36%, which would result in a sick leave rate of 50.8 employees/year (51.6% lower than the current configuration), as well as a production rate at 99% of capacity (a 92.7% increase over the current configuration). We found that reducing physical overload allows the “workforce control” loop to govern the system, producing favorable results. We conclude that setting the work cycle overly close to TAKT time leads to overload, due to the shorter recovery times at the end of each cycle. Thus, it is necessary to seek a balance between efficiency gains through downtime reduction and the physiological recovery of workers.}

A running protocol was completed by 57 trained runners (41 male) on four treadmills. Runners reported enjoyment levels as well as their perceptions about treadmill running surface, controls, safety and stability, physical interaction, learnability of data console and aesthetic appeal. Repeated measures ANOVAs showed significant differences between the treadmills for each variable. Multiple regression analysis reported aesthetic appeal significantly predicted enjoyment of use. Results suggest that adopting a user-centred approach to compare exercise equipment usability and features can correlate with enjoyment and further impact on physical activity adherence.}

Rigid shells of three sizes have been designed and 3D printed based on 3D foot scans. The test is performed in two positions: standing with load on the plantar surface and toe-off loading only the forefoot. The outcome is a pressure discomfort threshold map of the foot. Interestingly, in 16 locations the sensitivity was similar in both conditions (toe-off and complete foot on the ground). Especially, stretched areas showed increased sensitivity.}

During the distracted driving trial, participants drove while simultaneously completing the grocery list task (GLT), a semi-naturalistic working memory task developed by the authors. Results showed that participants were significantly slower at braking when a yellow traffic light appeared and during sudden braking events when distracted. Furthermore, the impairing effect of distraction on braking response time was partially mediated by WMC. There was also a trend towards a moderating effect of WMC, where the impairing effect of distraction was more pronounced for individuals with low WMC than high WMC. Theoretical and practical implications for the role of individual differences in cognition and driving, in-vehicle devices use and traffic safety, as well as semi-autonomous vehicle design are also discussed.}
