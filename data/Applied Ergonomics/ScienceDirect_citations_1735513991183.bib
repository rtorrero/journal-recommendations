abstract = {The main objective of this study was to examine the presence of chaos in the EEG recordings of brain activity under simulated unmanned ground vehicle visual detection scenarios with different levels of task difficulty. One hundred and fifty people participated in the experiment and completed four visual detection task scenarios: (1) change detection, (2) a threat detection task, (3) a dual-task with different change detection task rates, and (4) a dual-task with different threat detection task rates. We used the largest Lyapunov exponent and correlation dimension of the EEG data and performed 0–1 tests on the EEG data. The results revealed a change in the level of nonlinearity in the EEG data corresponding to different levels of cognitive task difficulty. The differences in EEG nonlinearity measures among the studied levels of task difficulty, as well as between a single task scenario and a dual-task scenario, have also been assessed. The results increase our understanding of the nature of unmanned systems' operational requirements.}

It is also well known that FLMs are strong determinants of good ergonomics and well-being for front-line staff. However, research focusing on how FLMs deal with their important role is lacking particularly regarding empirical studies. The focus here is how they deal with uncertainties and disruptive interruptions and develop more resilient performance in daily work – introduced in this article as resilient action strategies. This research uses two conceptual frameworks on resilient engineering for analysis of FLM's actions in daily work in two manufacturing companies, to explore how resilient action strategies can be organizationally supported. The study combines analysis of front-line activities with multilevel organizational support based on 30 semi-structured in-depth interviews with FLMs and support functions, 21 workshops as well as policy documents of the two companies. The analysis exemplifies how resilience engineering was enabled in practice in the organizations. The study contributes to the empirical understanding of how resilience can be organizationally supported in daily front-line work. Our results show that a developed and consistent infrastructure in companies promotes the emergence of resilient action strategies in front-line work. We propose an extended model for resilient front-line performance enhancement by including coordination as a linking aspect between the earlier suggested resilient potentials – anticipate, monitor, respond and learn. This highlights the importance of both organizational support and coordination between system levels to enable the development of resilient action strategies by FLMs.}

They stood on the 15 mm thick rubber anti-fatigue floor mat and on the standard antistatic polyvinyl chloride flooring surface during the surgical procedures. Subjective ratings of pain and fatigue levels were measured pre and after-surgery for each experimental condition using the Visual Analogue Scale and Fatigue-Visual Analogue Scale scales. The after-surgery pain and fatigue levels for the with-mat condition were significantly lower than the no mat condition (p < .05). Consequently, anti-fatigue floor mats are effective in decreasing pain and fatigue levels of surgical team members during surgical procedures. Using anti-fatigue mats may be a practical and easy way to prevent discomfort that is often experienced by surgical teams.}

Unless drivers have an appropriate mental model for the capabilities and limitations of the automation, they may not activate the automation safely or appropriately on the road, potentially leading to a collision. As such, a training package (L4DTP) was developed to improve drivers' decisions and behaviour when activating an AV system and this was evaluated in a between-subjects simulator experiment. Drivers received no training (NT, control group), read an owner's manual (OM, experimental group 1: current training provision) or underwent the L4DTP (experimental group 2: new training programme). All drivers then experienced five scenarios in a driving simulator where they encountered road conditions which were safe and unsafe for activation. Their activation decisions, behaviour, trust in automation, workload and mental models were measured. This experiment found that drivers who read the OM or underwent the L4DTP made better activation decisions and showed better activation behaviour compared to drivers who received NT. Additionally, drivers who underwent the L4DTP found it easier, less demanding and felt under less time pressure when making their decisions, had to expend less effort to reach the same activation performance and had more appropriate and comprehensive mental models for when the automation can be activated compared to drivers who read the OM. This L4DTP can make roads safer by reducing collisions linked to poor activation decisions and behaviour. Therefore, there is the potential for a real benefit for society if this training programme is adopted into mandatory AV driver training.}

This work takes a first step towards determining the pilot's state based on biosensor data. We conducted a simulator study to record participants' electrodermal activity and gaze behavior, indicating pilot state changes during three distinct flight phases in an instrument failure scenario. The results show a significant difference in these psychophysiological measures between a phase of regular flight, the incident phase, and a phase with an additional troubleshooting task after the failure. The differences in the observed measures suggest great potential for a pilot-aware cockpit that can provide assistance based on the sensed pilot state.}

In the search to identify those factors, the research objective was to test whether three-dimensional perception affects presence in virtual environments. A controlled within-group experiment utilizing perception and presence questionnaires was conducted, followed by data analysis, to test the hypothesized unidirectional association between three-dimensional perception and presence in two different virtual environments (non-immersive and immersive). Results indicate no association in either of the systems studied, contrary to the assumption of many scholars in the field but in line with recent studies on the topic. Consequently, VR applications in architectural design may not necessarily need to incorporate advanced stereoscopic visualization techniques to deliver highly immersive experiences, which may be achieved by addressing factors other than depth realism. As findings suggest that the levels of presence experienced by users are not subject to the display mode of a 3D model (whether immersive or non-immersive display), it may still be possible for professionals involved in the review of 3D models (e.g., designers, contractors, clients) to experience high levels of presence through non-stereoscopic VR systems provided that other presence-promoting factors are included.}

Both side lying and clutch-hold positions showed a greater degree of lumbar spine flexion compared to standing. In all sitting postures it was observed that the pelvis was placed in retroversion when compared to standing and side lying. In muscle activity, it was observed that the activation intensity of the right erector in the right side-supported side lying position was significantly lower compared to the rest of breastfeeding postures and standing. Side lying may be a better position to avoid muscle fatigue.}

Linear acceleration of the head and trunk were measured while participants used computer workstations in seated and standing positions during keyboard and mouse tasks; secondary measures were discomfort and proprioception (head and neck repositioning error). Median accelerations of the head and trunk were 20–26% lower in mouse tasks compared to keyboard tasks (p < 0.01). There were no significant differences in sway parameters between seated and standing positions. Discomfort and proprioception were correlated; subjects who experienced increased neck discomfort after 1.5 h of computer work had almost twice the head and neck repositioning error. The results suggest that postural sway is more affected by different tasks (keyboard vs. mouse) than by different workstation configurations and that low proprioception acuity may relate to the development of discomfort.}

Subjective discomfort rating in six body parts was measured using the Borg's CR-10 scale. The results showed that muscle activity (especially in the upper-limb muscles) was significantly decreased by 29.3–58.1% with both exoskeletons compared to no exoskeleton condition. The subjective discomfort ratings showed limited differences between the conditions.

Participants completed an uninhabited vehicle (UV) management task whereby they assigned the best UV to complete missions. Automation advised the best UV but was not always correct. Concurrent non-automated task demands decreased the accuracy of automation use, and increased decision time and perceived workload. With no concurrent task demands, increased transparency which provided more information on how the automation made decisions, improved the accuracy of automation use. With concurrent task demands, increased transparency led to higher trust ratings, faster decisions, and a bias towards agreeing with automation. These outcomes indicate increased reliance on highly transparent automation under conditions with concurrent task demands and have potential implications for human-automation teaming design.}

Accelerometric data were processed to obtain duration, intensity, and asymmetry of UL use in 32 HCWs during the execution of commonly performed tasks (e.g., patient hygiene, transfer, and meal distribution) within a regular shift. The results show that such tasks are characterized by significantly different patterns of UL use, in particular, higher intensities and larger asymmetries were observed respectively for patient hygiene and meal distribution. The proposed approach appears, thus, suitable to discriminate tasks characterized by different UL motion patterns. Future studies could benefit from the integration of such measures with self-reported workers’ perception to elucidate the relationship between dynamic UL movements and WRMSD.}

abstract = {Background
Training clinicians on the use of hospital-based patient monitoring systems (PMS) is vital to mitigate the risk of use errors and of frustration using these devices, especially when used in ICU settings. PMS training is typically delivered through face-to-face training sessions in the hospital. However, it is not always feasible to deliver training in this format to all clinical staff given some constraints (e.g., availability of staff and trainers to attend in-person training sessions and the costs associated with face-to-face training).
Objective
The literature indicates that E-learning has the potential to mitigate barriers associated with time restrictions for trainers and trainees and evidence shows it to be more flexible, and convenient for learners in healthcare settings. This study aimed to develop and carry out a preliminary evaluation via a case study of an e-learning training platform designed for a novel neonatal sepsis risk monitor system (Digi-NewB).
Methods
A multi-modal qualitative research case study approach was used, including the analysis of three qualitative data sources: (i) audio/video recordings of simulation sessions in which participants were asked to operate the system as intended (e.g., update the clinical observations and monitor the sepsis risk), (ii) interviews with the simulation participants and an attending key opinion leader (KOL), who observed all simulation sessions, and (iii) post-simulation survey.
Results
After receiving ethical approval for the study, nine neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) nurses completed the online training and participated in the simulation and follow-up interview sessions. The KOL was also interviewed, and seven out of the nine NICU nurses answered the post-simulation survey. The video/audio analysis of the simulations revealed that participants were able to use and interpret the Digi-NewB interface. Interviews with simulation participants and the KOL, and feedback extracted from the survey, revealed that participants were overall satisfied with the training platform and perceived it as an efficient and effective method to deliver medical device training.
Conclusions
This study developed an online training platform to train clinicians in the use of a critical care medical device and carried out a preliminary evaluation of the platform via a case study. The e-learning platform was designed to supplement and enhance other training approaches. Further research is required to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach.}

abstract = {The ability to drag a casualty to safety is critical for numerous physically demanding occupations. This study aimed to establish whether the pulling forces during a one-person 55 kg simulated casualty drag is representative of a two-person 110 kg drag. Twenty men completed up to 12 × 20m simulated casualty drags using a drag bag (55/110 kg) on a grassed sports pitch, with completion times and forces exerted measured. Completion time for the one-person 55 and 110 kg drags were 9.56 ± 1.18s and 27.08 ± 7.71s. Completion time for the 110 kg two-person drags for forwards and backwards iterations were 8.36 ± 1.23s and 11.04 ± 1.11s. The average individual force exerted during the one-person 55 kg drag was equivalent to the average individual contribution during the two-person 110 kg drag (t(16) = 3.3780, p < 0.001); suggesting a one-person 55 kg simulated casualty drag is representative of the individual contribution to a two-person 110 kg simulated casualty drag. Individual contributions can however vary during two-person simulated casualty drags.}

In a repeated-measures laboratory study, each of the 20 participants performed a series of AR tasks with and without a commercially-available upper-limb exoskeleton. During the AR tasks, muscle activity (anterior, middle, posterior deltoid, and upper trapezius), shoulder joint postures/moment, and self-reported discomfort were collected. The results showed that the exoskeleton significantly reduced muscle activity in the upper trapezius and deltoid muscle groups and self-reported discomfort. However, the shoulder postures and task performance measures were not affected by the exoskeleton during the AR interactions. Given the significant decrease in muscle activity and discomfort without compromising task performance, a passive exoskeleton can be an effective ergonomic control measure to reduce the risks of developing musculoskeletal discomfort or injuries in the shoulder regions.}

Empirical investigations often assess mental errors through threat identification, yet other cognitive failures could contribute to poor outcomes. The current study explored several possible sources of cognitive failures unrelated to threat identification with live fire exercises. Experiment 1 examined a national shooting competition to compare marksmanship accuracy, expertise, and planning in the likelihood of hitting no-shoot or unintended targets. Experts demonstrated an inverse speed/accuracy trade-off and fired upon fewer no-shoot targets than lesser skilled shooters, yet overall, greater opportunity to plan produced more no-shoot errors, thereby demonstrating an increase in cognitive errors. Experiment 2 replicated and extended this finding under conditions accounting for target type, location, and number. These findings further dissociate the roles of marksmanship and cognition in shooting errors while suggesting that marksmanship evaluations should be re-designed to better incorporate cognitive variables.}

In recent years, there has been an increased interest in the use of exoskeleton technology to reduce rates of WMSDs in industrial worksites. Despite the potential of exoskeletons to mitigate the risks of WMSDs, the required steps to properly assess and implement the technology for industrial applications are not clear. This paper proposes a framework that can help organizations successfully evaluate and adopt industrial exoskeletons. Through a focus group of industry professionals, researchers, and exoskeleton experts, and by building on existing literature, an overarching adoption framework is developed. The identified stages and tasks within the framework enable an organization to evaluate and adopt exoskeletons through a systematic approach and to identify the existing gaps in their technology adoption process. The findings also highlight the areas where further studies are needed to promote the adoption of industrial exoskeletons, including large-scale field studies and long-term monitoring.}

abstract = {Operating an aircraft requires pilots to handle a significant amount of multi-modal information, which creates a high working memory load. Detecting auditory alarms in this high-load scenario is crucial for aviation safety. According to cognitive control load theory, an increase in working memory load may enhance distractor interference, resulting in improved detection sensitivity for task-irrelevant stimuli. Therefore, understanding the effect of working memory load on auditory alarm detection is of particular interest in aviation safety research. The studies were designed to investigate the effect of storage load and executive function load of working memory on auditory alarm detection during aeronautical decision-making through three experiments. In Experiment 1 and 2, participants performed an aeronautical decision-making task while also detecting an auditory alarm during the retention interval of a working memory task (visual-spatial, visual-verbal and auditory-verbal). In Experiment 3, participants were required to detect an auditory alarm while performing the 2-back and 3-back aeronautical decision-making tasks. Experiment 1 found that the auditory alarm sensitivity was higher in conditions of low visual-spatial working memory storage load compare to high load conditions. Experiment 2 found that a high storage load of visual-verbal working memory reduced auditory alarm sensitivity but auditory-verbal working memory load did not. Experiment 3 found that, unlike storage load, auditory alarm sensitivity was stronger under high executive function load relative to low executive function load. These findings show that working memory storage load and executive function load have different effects on auditory alarm sensitivity. The relationship between executive function and auditory alarm sensitivity supports cognitive control load theory, while the impact of the storage function on auditory alarm sensitivity does not adhere to this theory.}

Mistaken-for-game or failure-to-identify hunting incidents refer to a hunter shooting an animal, often in haste, only to discover they have mistakenly targeted and shot a human. We sought to explore if individual differences, reaction times, peer or social pressure influence a decision to shoot quicker.
Method
We conducted a computer-based test involving volunteer participants (n = 202). All participants were shown videos of approaching stag, in which they had to indicate the moment they would shoot. The independent variables involved peer pressure, social media or reaction ‘influencers’ added before each video. Participants were also requested to complete individual difference surveys.
Results
Direct peer pressure and quick reaction test conditions presented quicker shooting times, whereas social media increased shooting times. No associations with individual differences were found.
Conclusions
The results suggest that hunters must ensure they minimise their distraction and influence from other people.}

This task was performed in six different conditions (3 work heights × 2 hand force directions), with each of three ASEs and in a control condition (i.e., no ASE). Using ASEs generally reduced the median activity of several shoulder muscles (by ∼12–60%), changed working postures, and decreased perceived exertion in several body regions. Such effects, though, were often task-dependent and differed between the ASEs. Our results support earlier evidence of the beneficial effects of ASEs for overhead work but emphasize that: 1) these effects depend on the task demands and ASE design and 2) none of the ASE designs tested was clearly superior across the tasks simulated.}

Twenty participants performed the two AR tasks with different error rates and target sizes. During the tasks, angles, moments, and muscle activity in the neck and shoulders were measured. The results showed that the target sizes and error rates significantly affected angles, moments, and muscle activity in the neck and shoulder regions. Specifically, the presence of errors increased neck extension, shoulder flexion angles and associated moments. Muscle activity in the neck (splenius capitis) and shoulder (anterior and medial deltoids) also increased when the errors were introduced. Moreover, interacting with larger targets resulted in greater neck extension moments and shoulder abduction angles along with higher muscle activity in the splenius capitis and upper trapezius muscles. These findings indicate the importance of reducing errors and incorporating appropriate target sizes in the AR interfaces to minimize risks of musculoskeletal discomfort and injuries in the neck and shoulders.}

Measures of presence, task performance, workload, and anxiety were taken to determine the effect of robot motion in all three environments. Task performance decreased in response to robot motion in the physical environment, while workload and anxiety increased. This simple effect of motion was consistent across environments for measures of task performance and anxiety. However, people performed faster overall in virtual reality, and the effect of motion on workload was greatly reduced in virtual reality. Results in the virtual environments suggest that people were distracted by the sound of the robot, and that presence was affected by manipulations of immersion and coherence.}

abstract = {Marksmanship performance while moving is a critical skill among tactical athletes due to the high demands of their occupational duties. Qualifications for dynamic marksmanship performance are not standardized across tactical athlete groups, which may limit comprehensive assessment of tactical athlete performance for situational awareness and adaptability to an unpredictable environment. Although static marksmanship performance provides foundational information on skills and level of ability, research is lacking on factors that influence dynamic marksmanship performance to best prepare tactical athletes for duties. The purpose of this study was to identify whether static marksmanship performance, speed of movement, load carriage, and biomechanical factors while ‘shooting on the move’ influenced dynamic marksmanship performance. Twenty-four male tactical athletes (22 active-duty Army Soldiers, two civilian SWAT operators; age: 23.83 ± 5.47 years; height: 1.80 ± 0.08 m; weight: 81.04 ± 7.87 kg) participated; final analyses did not include data from the two civilian operators to maintain sample homogeneity. Tactical athletes completed static and dynamic (‘shoot on the move’) marksmanship tasks under three load conditions: (1) no load (NL), (2) half kit (HK) of 11.34 kg, and (3) full kit (KIT) of 22.68 kg. Dynamic marksmanship was completed under three speed conditions: (1) self-selected slow speed, (2) standard speed, and (3) self-selected fast speed. Hip, knee, and ankle kinematics were collected via wireless inertial measurement units. Spatiotemporal parameters were collected via optical detection system. Marksmanship performance (accuracy) was collected via open-air acoustic target scoring and mean radial error (MRE) was calculated for both static and dynamic marksmanship tasks. Linear mixed-effects models were fit with dynamic MRE as the outcome variable with fixed effects of static MRE, load condition, speed condition, kinematics, and spatiotemporal parameters, adjusting for body mass. Alpha level was set a priori at p ≤ 0.10. The final statistical model included fixed effects of static MRE, load condition, speed condition, and time spent in double limb support. Static MRE (p < 0.01) and time spent in double limb support (p = 0.01) were significant factors. For each 1 cm increase in static MRE there was a 0.66 cm increase in dynamic MRE. For every 1% increase in time spent in double limb support while ‘shooting on the move’ there was a 0.13 cm increase in dynamic MRE. Findings from this study highlight that tactical athletes who have larger static stance MRE and spend a longer time in double limb support during a gait cycle exhibit an increase in MRE during ‘shoot on the move’ trials. Overall, dynamic shooting accuracy is not affected by lower extremity joint angles, load carriage, or speed of movement. Although strong relationships are known between gait speed, load, and lower extremity kinematics, the differences in tactical gait compared to normal gait and multi-task paradigm that likely favors marksmanship accuracy seem to present novel movement characteristics unique to occupational gait. Further investigation is warranted to identify other potential factors that may improve or worsen dynamic marksmanship performance.}

abstract = {Due to their working position, violinists are more prone to musculoskeletal pain than other instrumentalists. Playing the violin may cause increased activity in the shoulder and forearm muscles due to techniques such as vibrato (pitch variation), double-fingering (thirds), and changes in speed and volume (piano and forte). This study investigated how the different violin techniques affect muscle activity while playing scales and a music piece. Surface EMG was recorded bilaterally from the upper trapezius and forearm muscles in 18 violinists. Increased playing speed followed by playing with vibrato was the most demanding task affecting the left forearm muscles. Playing forte was the most demanding factor for the right forearm muscles. The music piece and the grand mean of all techniques showed similar workload demands. These results show that specific techniques require higher workload demands and should be considered when planning rehearsals with these techniques as a part of injury prevention.}

However, multiple resource theory suggests that certain timeshared tasks might interfere with listeners’ ability to understand spearcons. We tested the relative interference with spearcon identification from the following ongoing tasks: (1) manual tracking, (2) linguistic detection of spoken target words, (3) arithmetic true-false judgments, or (4) an ignored background speech control. Participants were 80 non-clinicians. The linguistic task worsened spearcon identification more than the tracking task, p < .001, and more than ignored background speech, p = .012. The arithmetic task worsened spearcon identification more than the tracking task, p < .001. The linguistic task and arithmetic task both worsened performance, p = .674. However, no ongoing task affected participants’ ability to detect which patient(s) in a sequence had abnormal vital signs. Future research could investigate whether timeshared tasks affect non-speech auditory alerts.}

Full-scale vertical acceleration measurements were conducted near work and accommodation areas on the vessel. A daily diary survey was used to gather human responses among passengers. In addition, instantaneous slamming vibration comfort ratings were obtained by observers on the ship Bridge during a test sequence that purposefully induced slamming. The results indicate that two different approaches converged to the same VDV1hr comfort threshold (0.41 m/s1.75 and 0.43 m/s1.75), which corresponds to the limit where 50% of respondents indicated discomfort. A similar analysis using the r.m.s. metric converged to an identical threshold (0.03 m/s2), irrespective of the accumulated time of assessment.}

The results showed that the ergonomic control reduced trunk and shoulder angles, L5/S1, and shoulder moments; muscle activities in low back, shoulders, and upper extremities; perceived exertion ratings; and postural sway measures. Moreover, these measures were lowest when the bar height was at 60 cm, indicating that the banger bar can reduce the risk of musculoskeletal injuries and postural instability, and that bar height is an important factor affecting these injury risk measures.}

Additionally, the recovery strategies (i.e., the displacement of the foot after tripping) were classified. Wearing safety shoes, the linear momentum of the foot and whole leg increased, and the vertical position of the whole-body CoM was lower after the perturbation. Additionally, the recovery strategy when wearing safety shoes demonstrated a lower displacement of the foot. In conclusion, wearing safety shoes was found to have negative biomechanical effects when having to circumvent a trip, and this potentially increased the risk of falling.}

During the pandemic, home care nurses and managers experienced both an increased workload and psychosocial strain. For managers, the increased complexity of work was a major problem. We identify three key takeaways related to sustainable crisis management: 1) to support managers’ ability to provide social support to their personnel, 2) to increase crisis communication preparedness, and 3) to apply a holistic perspective on protective gear use. We also conclude that the competing pressures model is useful when exploring the dynamics of the work environment in complex organizational contexts.}

We then compared a breast cancer screening PEM created by user experience designers with two other breast cancer screening PEMS, finding that the PEM based on UXD had higher perceived usability, and lower mentions of usability problems, than the other two PEMs (Study 2). We next examined the impact of individual differences in design expertise on perceived usability, this time including a PEM on cervical cancer screening as well as one on breast cancer screening (Study 3). Our concluding study (Study 4) then examined the impacts of UXD on learnability of PEM content as defined by answers to a knowledge questionnaire about screening administered before and after reading the PEM, and by intention to screen for cancer after reading the PEM. The first three studies showed that the involvement of UXD improved the perceived usability of PEMs, and Study 3 showed that designers differ in their ability to create useable PEMs. Study 4 failed to find a corresponding improvement in learnability or intention to screen when UXD was used to improve perceived usability. We conclude that a user experience design approach that incorporates graphic design can improve the perceived usability of PEMs in some situations (e.g., when the PEM material is not too lengthy or complex, and when the graphic designer is sufficiently skilled). However, we found no evidence that lack of perceived usability accounted for the failure of PEMS (found in previous research) to improve knowledge or intention to screen.}

This study analysed an anticipated invasive BCI system lifecycle to identify the individual, organisational, and societal risks associated with BCIs, and controls that could be used to mitigate or eliminate these risks. A BCI system lifecycle work domain analysis model was developed and validated with 10 subject matter experts. The model was subsequently used to undertake a systems thinking-based risk assessment approach to identify risks that could emerge when functions are either undertaken sub-optimally or not undertaken at all. Eighteen broad risk themes were identified that could negatively impact the BCI system lifecycle in a variety of unique ways, while a larger number of controls for these risks were also identified. The most concerning risks included inadequate regulation of BCI technologies and inadequate training of BCI stakeholders, such as users and clinicians. In addition to specifying a practical set of risk controls to inform BCI device design, manufacture, adoption, and utilisation, the results demonstrate the complexity involved in managing BCI risks and suggests that a system-wide coordinated response is required. Future research is required to evaluate the comprehensiveness of the identified risks and the practicality of implementing the risk controls.}

While much research has focused on adverse medication errors, limited studies have specifically examined ‘normal’ medication delivery performance and the interactions between tasks, agents, and information within the medication administration system. This article describes a study that applied the Event Analysis of Systemic Teamwork (EAST) model to study the hospital medication administration system to identify opportunities to optimise performance and patient safety. Key findings of this study demonstrate that this is a highly complex system, comprising many social agents and a relatively closely linked series of tasks and information. However, most of the workload relies on a small proportion of healthcare professionals. Significantly, the patient has a minimal role in the medication administration system during their hospital stay. The research has shown that this approach enables mapping networks and their interdependencies to optimise the system as a whole rather than its parts in isolation.}

Nurse decision making (DM) is critical for patient safety. Eye-tracking methods can effectively assess nurse DM. The purpose of this pilot study was to use eye-tracking methods to assess nurse DM during a clinical simulation.
Materials and methods
Experienced nurses managed a simulated patient manikin who suffered from a stroke mid-simulation. We assessed nurses’ gaze patterns prior to and after the stroke. DM in general was assessed by nursing faculty using a clinical judgement rubric, and dichotomously based on recognition of the stroke or not.
Results
Data from eight experienced nurses was examined. For the nurses who recognized the stroke, visual attention was focused on the vital sign monitor and patient's head, which suggest those locations were consistently examined for correct decision-makers.
Conclusions
Dwell time on general AOIs was associated with poorer DM, which may reflect poorer pattern recognition. Eye-tracking metrics may be effective to objectively assess nurse DM.}

Solutions to facilitate safe and acceptable interactions in future automated traffic include equipping automated vehicles and vulnerable road users, such as cyclists, with awareness or notification systems, as well as connecting road users to a network of motorised vehicles and infrastructure. This paper provides a synthesis of the current literature on communication technologies, systems, and devices available to cyclists, including technologies present in the environment and on motorised interaction partners such as vehicles, and discusses the outlook for technology-driven solutions in future automated traffic. The objective is to identify, classify, and count the technologies, systems, and devices that have the potential to aid cyclists in traffic with automated vehicles. Additionally, this study aims to extrapolate the potential benefits of these systems and stimulate discourse on the implications of connected vulnerable road users. We analysed and coded 92 support systems using a taxonomy of 13 variables based on the physical, communicational, and functional attributes of the systems. The discussion frames these systems into four categories: cyclist wearables, on-bike devices, vehicle systems, and infrastructural systems, and highlights the implications of the visual, auditory, motion-based, and wireless modes of communication of the devices. The most common system was cyclist wearables (39%), closely followed by on-bike devices (38%) and vehicle systems (33%). Most systems communicated visually (77%). We suggest that interfaces on motorised vehicles accommodate cyclists with visibility all around the car and incorporate two-way communication. The type of system and the effect of communication modality on performance and safety needs further research, preferably in complex and representative test scenarios with automated vehicles. Finally, our study highlights the ethical implications of connected road users and suggests that the future outlook of transport systems may benefit from a more inclusive and less car-centred approach, shifting the burden of safety away from vulnerable road users and promoting more cyclist-friendly solutions.}

For organizations to learn to adapt effectively, there is a need to understand the perspectives of the frontline workforce involved in everyday operations. This study implemented a survey-tool to elicit narratives of successful adaptation based on the lived experiences frontline radiology staff at a large multispecialty pediatric hospital. Fifty-eight members of the radiology frontline staff responded to the tool between July and October of 2020. Qualitative analysis of the free-text data revealed five categories of themes that underpinned adaptive capacity of the radiology department during the pandemic: information flow, attitudes and initiative, new and adjusted workflows, availability and utilization of resources, and collaboration and teamwork. Enablers of adaptive capacity included timely and clear communication about procedures and policies from the leadership to frontline staff, and revised workflows with flexible work arrangements, such as remote patient screening. Responses to multiple choice questions in the tool helped identify the main categories of challenges faced by staff, factors that enabled successful adaptation, and resources used. The study demonstrates the use of a survey-tool to proactively identify frontline adaptations. The paper also reports a system-wide intervention resulting directly from a discovery enabled by the findings based on the use of RETIPS in the radiology department. In general, the tool could be used in concert with existing learning mechanisms, such as safety event reporting systems, to inform leadership-level decisions to support adaptive capacity.}

abstract = {In high-risk environments, fast and accurate responses to warning systems are essential to efficiently handle emergency situations. The aim of the present study was twofold: 1) investigating whether hand action videos (i.e., gesture alarms) trigger faster and more accurate responses than text alarm messages (i.e., written alarms), especially when mental workload (MWL) is high; and 2) investigating the brain activity in response to both types of alarms as a function of MWL. Regardless of MWL, participants (N = 28) were found to be both faster and more accurate when responding to gesture alarms than to written alarms. Brain electrophysiological results suggest that this greater efficiency might be due to a facilitation of the action execution, reflected by the decrease in mu and beta power observed around the response time window observed at C3 and C4 electrodes. These results suggest that gesture alarms may improve operators’ performances in emergency situations.}

An ergonomic irregular hexagon handle, with a 1:1.25 width/length diameters ratio, has been developed. Left upper limb kinematics and neuromuscular activity, perceived comfort and power production were monitored for 29 expert rowers. The ergonomic handle increased the perceived comfort while maintaining the overall articular stress and performance as the same level compared to the regular handle. We recommend using irregular hexagon handles with 1:1.25 ratio for ergometer rowing. Further improvements of the ergonomic handle such as an individualization based on the user's hand length may further enhance comfort and achieve better performance.}

abstract = {Objectives
Workplace management practices targeting risk of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) fail to reflect evidence that risk is affected by psychosocial as well as physical hazards. To promote improved practices in occupations where MSD risk is highest, better information is needed on how psychosocial hazards, combined with physical hazards, affect risk of workers in these occupations.
Methods
Survey ratings of physical and psychosocial hazards by 2329 Australian workers in occupations with high MSD risk were subjected to Principal Components Analysis. Latent Profile Analysis of hazard factor scores identified different combinations of hazards to which latent subgroups of workers were typically exposed. Survey ratings of frequency and severity of musculoskeletal discomfort or pain (MSP) generated a pre-validated MSP score and its relationship with subgroup membership was analysed. Demographic variables associated with group membership were investigated using regression modelling and descriptive statistics.
Results
Analyses identified three physical and seven psychosocial hazard factors and three participant subgroups with differing hazard profiles. Profile group differences were greater for psychosocial than physical hazards, and MSP scores out of 60 ranged from 6.7 for the low hazard profile (29% of participants) to 17.5 for the high hazard profile (21%). Differences between occupations in hazard profiles were not large.
Conclusions
Both physical and psychosocial hazards affect MSD risk of workers in high-risk occupations. In workplaces such as this large Australian sample where risk management has focused on physical hazards, actions targeting psychosocial hazards may now be the most effective way to reduce risk further.}

This study explores using ocular metrics for tracking changes in physical fatigue during the completion of a repeated handle push/pull task. Participants completed this task over three trials, and pupil size was recorded by means of a head-mounted eye-tracker. Blink frequency was also measured. Force impulse and maximum peak force were used as ground-truth measures of physical fatigue. As expected, a reduction in peak force and impulse was observed over time as participants became more fatigued. More interestingly, pupil size was also found to decrease from trial 1 through trial 3. No changes in blink rate were found with increasing physical fatigue. While exploratory in nature, these findings add to the sparse literature exploring the use of ocular metrics in Ergonomics. They also advance the use of pupil size as a possible future alternative for physical fatigue detection.}

Despite the importance of live captioning for accessibility, little is known about the subjective workload of captioners in this context. This study aimed to measure the subjective workload of live captioners using the NASA-TLX and to explore the factors that contribute to their mental workload. Thirty live captioners participated in the study, completing questionnaires and interviews. Results showed that the subjective mental workload of live captioners is high, similar to that of neurosurgeons. The mental workload was found to be associated with caption paraphrasing and employment status. The challenges of the job, such as the speed of speaking in live content, cognitive tasks involved in paraphrasing, the concern about poor performance, the impact on audiences, and the lack of control over job scheduling contribute to this high workload. These findings suggest the need for modulating the scheduling of the workers, having longer breaks, and working in teams rather than independently. Introducing paradigm changes for live captioning workflow, such as reducing the human effort of typing by adopting auto-generated captions, so that captioners become decision-makers or managers of generational AI systems should also be considered. By addressing these issues, we can help improve the well-being of live captioners and the quality of captions, ultimately enhancing accessibility for all.}

A hybrid approach of inductive and deductive thematic analysis of the responses of 36 participants was undertaken. Eight such attributes emerged from the analysis, including statistical reliability and dependability, competence, predictability, familiarity, authority/subversion, liberty/oppression, care/harm, and sanctity/degradation. The first four are objective attributes concerning automation trustworthiness and human trust in automation, while the remaining four are subjective attributes, analogous to properties of human morality.

Physiological limits imposed by vest-borne loads must be defined for optimal performance monitoring of the modern dismounted warfighter.
Purpose
To evaluate how weighted vests affect locomotion economy and relative cardiometabolic strain during military load carriage while identifying key physiological predictors of exhaustion limits.
Methods
Fifteen US Army soldiers (4 women, 11 men; age, 26 ± 8 years; height, 173 ± 10 cm; body mass (BM), 79 ± 16 kg) performed four incremental walking tests with different vest loads (0, 22, 44, or 66% BM). We examined the effects of vest-borne loading on peak walking speed, the physiological costs of transport, and relative work intensity. We then sought to determine which of the cardiometabolic indicators (oxygen uptake, heart rate, respiration rate) was most predictive of task failure.
Results
Peak walking speed significantly decreased with successively heavier vest loads (p < 0.01). Physiological costs per kilometer walked were significantly higher with added vest loads for each measure (p < 0.05). Relative oxygen uptake and heart rate were significantly higher during the loaded trials than the 0% BM trial (p < 0.01) yet not different from one another (p > 0.07). Conversely, respiration rate was significantly higher with the heavier load in every comparison (p < 0.01). Probability modeling revealed heart rate as the best predictor of task failure (marginal R2, 0.587, conditional R2, 0.791).
Conclusion
Heavy vest-borne loads cause exceptional losses in performance capabilities and increased physiological strain during walking. Heart rate provides a useful non-invasive indicator of relative intensity and task failure during military load carriage.}

Ergonomists have commonly used two methods to calculate angular movement velocities of the upper arms using inertial measurement units (accelerometers and gyroscopes). Generalized velocity is the speed of movement traveled on the unit sphere per unit time. Inclination velocity is the derivative of the postural inclination angle relative to gravity with respect to time. Neither method captures the full extent of upper arm angular velocity. We propose a new method, the gyroscope vector magnitude (GVM), and demonstrate how GVM captures angular velocities around all motion axes and more accurately represents the true angular velocities of the upper arm. We use optical motion capture data to demonstrate that the previous methods for calculating angular velocities capture 89% and 77% relative to our proposed method.}

Much of team coordination happens through communication; understanding team communication is vital to better formulate and train teams for successful performance outcomes. Several decades of team communication research have led to various methods for analyzing team communication patterns. Many existing methods for team communication analysis have not been tested with naturalistic communication or only consider the frequency or flow of communication. Sliding-window entropy is used to analyze team coordination dynamics with team communication as a proxy. The resulting time series are evaluated using nonlinear dynamical systems analysis and clustering. Various team coordination patterns are identified using communication entropy at the team level. Entropy can be used to identify team communication patterns and their relation to team performance. While team coordination happens at the team level, a posteriori analysis indicates members' individual characteristics affect the overall team coordination patterns. In teams where the contribution is unequal, some members disproportionately affect the overall team coordination, which may undermine the team impact and affect team performance.}

Ambulatory dual-task scenarios reveal how attention is divided between walking and additional tasks, but the impact of walking speed and dual-task modality on gait characteristics and dual-task performance is unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of visual and tactile-visual dual-task on gait performance. Participants (n=15) targeted four speeds (0.5, 1.0, 1.3, and 1.5 m/s) on a self-paced treadmill with a visual speed indicator (a green region centered at the target speed). Participants completed the same speed profile on the treadmill without (Self-Paced) and with a response time dual task (Self-Paced with Dual Task) requiring finger-tap responses to go/no-go cues. Six gait characteristics were calculated: proportion of time in the desired speed green region (GTP), speed ratio (ratio of mean to target speed), time to green region after target speed change (NRT), normalized stride width (NSW), normalized stride length (NSL), and stride time (ST). Both stride length and width were normalized by participant leg length. Lower GTP and greater speed ratio at slower speeds during dual tasking indicate speed-dependent changes in gait characteristics. Changes in NSL and ST were more affected by speed than dual task. These findings support that when speed is a parameter that is tracked, participants do not universally decrease speed in the presence of a dual task. These findings can support the decisions made when designing new wearable technologies that support navigation, communication, and mobility.}

However, when mentally fatigued and wearing the exoskeleton, movement duration significantly increased compared to the baseline condition (βMF:Exo = 0.17, p = .02, ω2 = .03), suggesting an important interaction between the exoskeleton and one's psychobiological state. Importantly, presented data indicate a negative effect on production efficiency through increased performance time. Further research into the cognitive aspects of industrial work performance and human-exoskeleton interaction is therefore warranted.}

abstract = {We investigated the effect of hypoxia on the reaction time (RT) and response accuracy of pilots performing a visual choice reaction task that corresponded to the scanning of helmet mounted display (HMD) symbology. Eighteen male military pilots performed the task in a hypobaric chamber at two simulated altitudes (92 m and 4572 m) in a single-blinded repeated measures and counter-balanced design. The visual stimuli were displayed in low and high contrast and at a 30- and 50-degree field of view (FoV). We measured the pilots' RT and response accuracy. Using an eye tracker, we measured the pilot's glance time at each stimulus location. Finally, we collected subjective ratings of alertness. The results show that hypoxia increased the RT and glance time. Lowering the stimulus contrast and increasing the FoV further increased the RT, independent of hypoxia. These findings provide no evidence for hypoxia-induced changes in visual contrast sensitivity or visual field. Instead, hypoxia seemed to affect RT and glance time by reducing alertness. Despite the increased RT, the pilots maintained their accuracy on the visual task, suggesting that visual scanning of HMD symbology may be resistant to the effects of acute hypoxia.}

However, autonomous human motion/intention perception is a primary barrier in e-waste remanufacturing. To address the research gap, this study combined experimental data collection with deep learning models for accurate disassembly task recognition. Over 570,000 frames of motion data were collected from inertial measurement units (IMU) worn by 22 participants. A novel sequence-based correction (SBC) algorithm was also proposed to further improve the accuracy of the overall pipeline. Results showed that models (CNN, LSTM, and GoogLeNet) had an overall accuracy of 88–92%. The proposed SBC algorithm improved accuracy to 95%.}

This study aimed to contribute to existing data on household chemicals and consumer safety by applying a novel observational method using virtual reality (VR). The study participants (N = 119) were observed after receiving a task to childproof a virtual apartment from various interactable neutral and hazardous objects (i.e. knives, lighters and household chemicals with and without warnings) that were placed in the virtual apartment. For the analysis, the object placement (i.e. accessible or inaccessible to the children) and the level of interaction with the objects were coded, and the observational data were supplemented with data gathered through a questionnaire. The results showed that most hazardous household chemicals were moved to spots that were inaccessible to the children without any interactions of the participants with the warnings. Instead, they used their pre-existing knowledge and intuitive strategies to judge the objects’ risks. These potentially misleading intuitive strategies should be increasingly considered in the regulation of hazardous household chemicals. This study also discussed the use and limitations of VR for the observation of human behaviour and decision making under uncertainty.}

One method that can be used at the start of the training lifecycle to establish the tasks and competencies that are required for a task/job and is considered an important activity to perform when developing a training programme is a Training Needs Analysis (TNA). This article presents a new TNA approach and uses an Automated Vehicle (AV) case study to demonstrate this new approach for a specific AV scenario within the current UK road system. A Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA) was performed in order to identify the overall goal and tasks that drivers need to perform to operate the AV system safely on the road. This HTA identified 7 main tasks which were decomposed into 26 sub-tasks and 2428 operations. Then, six AV driver training themes from the literature were combined with the Knowledge, Skills and Attitudes (KSA) taxonomy to identify the KSAs that drivers need to perform the tasks, sub-tasks and operations that were identified in the HTA (training needs). This resulted in the identification of over 100 different training needs. This new approach helped to identify more tasks, operations and training needs than previous TNAs which applied the KSA taxonomy alone. As such, a more comprehensive TNA for drivers of the AV system was produced. This can be more easily translated into the development and evaluation of future training programmes for drivers of AV systems.}

Twenty-four participants performed single and dual-task (i.e. concurrent performance of cognitive tasks) standing while wearing a duty belt, tactical vest, and no load. The postural stability and muscle activity were measured and effects of condition and task examined. Dual task standing decreased postural stability and increased muscular activity. The belt and vest (7.2 kg each) increased muscle activity compared to control for the right abdominals, low back, right thigh. The duty belt resulted in less muscle activity in the right abdominals but more muscle activity in the left multifidus compared to the control. The findings indicate that common law enforcement load carriage systems increase muscular activity but do not affect postural stability. However, the lack of differences between the duty belt and tactical vest did not provide clear support for one load carriage system versus the other.}

We also compared these results to previous studies employing the tone counting tasks with physically demanding tasks (climbing, kayaking and running). The interference between tone counting and mathematical calculations was worse than the interference between tone counting and running and kayaking. For climbing, the difference in interference was more nuanced with evidence indicating climbing uniquely asserts task prioritization. These findings have implications for operations requiring dual or multi-tasking.}

However, the overall high static muscle activity (4–10 %MVE across all muscles) was maintained using EC. For both setups, the head posture was left-rotated >15°, ≤6° flexed and left-bent 90% of the time. The EC did not produce a substantial difference in biomechanical load. Instead, future studies may focus on aspects other than chinrest design to lower the static workload demands.}

Eleven non-disabled males and 10 males with a C4–C7 spinal cord injury completed isometric strength tests on parasagittal (XY) planes using a novel method. Multidirectional (XY) force measurements were taken at discrete points within the participant's reach envelope. Isometric force trends and analysis of the coefficients of variation were used to evaluate the novel methodology. The isometric force trends were consistent in showing a reduction in strength for people with higher injury levels. Analysis of the coefficient of variation showed that the methodology produces repeatable results with an average coefficient of variation of 18% and 19% for the right and left upper limbs, respectively. These results show that the novel testing methodology is a reliable way to gather quantitative multidirectional upper limb strength data for individuals in a seated position.}

We investigated the effects of time on task and task load on visual inspection performance in a four-month field study with screeners. At an international airport, 22 screeners inspected X-ray images of cabin baggage for up to 60 min, while a control group (N = 19) screened for 20 min. Hit rate remained stable for low and average task loads. However, when the task load was high, the screeners compensated by speeding up X-ray image inspection at the expense of the hit rate over time on task. Our results support the dynamic-allocation resource theory. Moreover, extending the permitted screening duration to 30 or 40 min should be considered.}

Tests were repeated four times to determine between-session reliability. Intraclass correlation coefficients demonstrated ‘Good’ to ‘Excellent’ reliability, except for one condition. Polynomial regression equations were developed for each condition to predict exoskeleton support for any upper-limb elevation angle between 10° and 180°.

This study tested the immediate effects of using vibrotactile feedback in simulated construction work tasks including lifting-lowering, shoveling, and tying rebar, to investigate the potential for such an intervention as a way to instruct workers in reducing excessive trunk flexion exposures. Fourteen male participants completed simulated work tasks with three different feedback locations, namely, no feedback, back, and wrist. The results demonstrate that the 95th, 90th, and 50th percentiles of trunk flexion angles are significantly lower for lifting-lowering and shoveling tasks when the feedback system is used. No significant postural changes were observed for the rebar tying task at any combination of percentile and feedback location. The rating of perceived exertion (RPE) for each task did not differ significantly between feedback conditions. Productivity remained the same with the feedback for lifting-lowering and rebar tying, while it was significantly reduced (4.5% of working rate reduction) in shoveling. Participants rated the wrist as the most preferred feedback location. The results of this study suggest that vibrotactile feedback has potential as an effective postural intervention for ergonomic risk factors in selected construction work tasks. Implications for the future design of real-time wearable, sensor-based vibrotactile feedback systems for postural control intervention during dynamic work tasks are discussed.}

The scores were analysed using a variety of methods (statistical tests, Principal Component Analysis, Linear Mixed Models). Long pull-out distances and manoeuvre duration values, as well as lower speeds were preferred by the participants, with some limited impact of the driving situation. Overall, behaviour simulating an average, cautious human driver is likely to positively influence acceptability and suggests the value of further research on context-adaptive automated driving to account for subjective risk perception.

Exoskeleton use resulted in lower muscle activity of anterior deltoid (13–39%) and upper trapezius (16–60%) and reduced perceived effort. Additionally, it induced an offset in shoulder flexion and abduction during resting position (8–10°). No conclusions on familiarization could be drawn due to low adherence to the protocol.

In this study, we developed an ultra-wideband sensor-based human-machine-environment framework for layout and workflow assessments within the OR. In addition to providing best practices for use of the framework, we also demonstrated its effectiveness in understanding layout and workflow inefficiencies in 12 robotic-assisted surgeries (RAS) across 4 different surgical specialties. We found avoidable movements as the circulating nurse covers at least twice the distance of any other OR personnel before the patient cart (robot) is docked. OR areas of congestion and undesirable personnel-pair proximities across RAS phases that impose extra non-technical skill challenges were determined. Our findings highlight several implications for the added complexity of integrating robotic technologies into the OR, which can serve as drivers for objective evidence-based recommendations to combat RAS OR layout and workflow inefficiencies.}

abstract = {Stroke is characterized by high morbidity and disability, and proposing effective methods for assessing and designing rehabilitation products is an attractive topic in current research. In this study, a hand function rehabilitation aid was developed for stroke patients. Ten stroke patients and 20 healthy older people as a control group were recruited to perform a 600 s task after a 600 s resting by gripping a stick while clicking on a flashing light in an electronic insert in sequence according to a pattern. The functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and behavioral data were collected during their rehabilitation training. Brain function was analyzed using three indicators, namely brain area activation, functional connectivity and effective connectivity, while behavioral performance was analyzed using ten indicators, such as velocity and acceleration, and correlations were made between both. Followed by proposing a quantitative assessment method based on the fusion of multiple data sources. The results showed that the developed rehabilitation tool could effectively stimulate the patient's brain and help recover their cognitive and behavioral capacities. The scientific validity of the proposed assessment approach was further confirmed by contrasting the data results of the stroke group with those of the healthy elderly group. This study has integrated brain function and behavioral data, providing a practical quantitative evaluation method of product ergonomics and data-driven product design concepts for stroke patients.}

A systematic study was conducted by general keyword searches of five electronic databases over the last two decades (2003–2022). Out of the 701 records initially retrieved, 33 eligible articles were included and analyzed in the final review, presenting a variety of model inputs, model development, and model outputs used in the modelling. This systematic review study revealed that existing modelling methods can evaluate the biomechanical and physiological effects of industrial exoskeletons and provide some design parameters. However, the modelling method is currently unable to cover some of the main evaluation metrics supported by experimental assessments, such as task performance, user experience/discomfort, change in metabolic costs etc. Standard guidelines for model construction and implementation, as well as validation of human-exoskeleton interactions, remain to be established.}

We conducted an analysis on 36 interviews – representing 12 roles – collected from a scenario-based evaluation of T3.

Designing technology that meets every role's needs is challenging; in particular, when trade-offs need to be managed, e.g., additional workload for one role or divergent perspectives regarding specific features. Our results confirm the usefulness of a continuous work system approach to technology design and implementation.}

Decision making in use of force relies on accurate cue identification to inform appropriate response. This research was designed to test the relationship between cue utilisation and performance prior to, and following participation in an urban operations course (UOC).
Methods
A total of 37 participants were assessed on cue utilisation measures, course outcome and between group changes following course participation.
Results
A significant main effect was evident for Cue utilisation and administration, (p = 0.005), but not training group, (p = 0.54), nor between groups and point of administration, (p = 0.410). No main effect was evident between groups and training outcome, (p = 0.11). However, there was a main effect for point of administration, (p = 0.02) and training outcome and point of administration (p = 0.02).
Conclusion
Although cue utilisation is an essential component of perception-action tasks, cues may be more specific to the relevant training environment with limited transfer to the operational context.}

abstract = {The black hole illusion (BHI) is a subtype of spatial disorientation that can result in fatal consequences in aviation. Research on the BHI has generally focused on altitude deviation, and few studies have examined the effect across different flight phases. In a simulation-based experiment, 18 participants performed 12 simulated approach and landing tasks in normal and BHI environments. Flight performance was analyzed with 14 flight parameters and was compared across five points and three phases, which were referenced from a National Transportation Safety Board report and other previous studies. Results showed that multiple flight parameters were significantly impaired and that their influences varied from the initial approach to the final touchdown. In the BHI environment, participants tended to descend aggressively during the approach phase and flew a lower but similar glidepath during the last approach phase. They might have realized the abnormal situation induced by the BHI but usually were unable to recover from the dangerous maneuver in time. Additionally, the result of glide path error, one of the most commonly used variables in previous BHI research, was only significant during the last approach phase. Flight stability was also impaired in the BHI environment. This is the first study to systematically analyze the BHI effects on multiple flight parameters at different flight phases. The use of this experimental paradigm could facilitate future research to evaluate and prevent the BHI in a more comprehensive way.}

The representations were presented in random order and participants were asked to respond to sixteen questions to the best of their ability after visually scanning the related graph. There were two trials on two separate days for each participant. Eye movements were recorded using an eye tracker. Bar and line graphs show superiority over circular and radial graphs in effectiveness, efficiency, and perceived ease of use primarily due to eye saccades. The radar graph had the worst performance. “Vibration-type” fill pattern could be improved by adding colors and symbolic fills. Design guidelines are proposed for the effective representation of data so that the presentation and communication of information are effective.}

Sitting posture may contribute to spinal pain. Effects of postures on pain, sensitivity and muscle activity during computer tasks were investigated.
Methods
Twenty-five healthy participants, seated at a workstation without backrest, completed four, 15-min typing tasks: A)Upright with forearm-support; B)Upright without forearm-support; C)Slumped with forearm-support; D)Slumped without forearm-support. Participants rated pain every minute on a numerical rating scale (NRS). RMS-EMG was recorded from upper/lower trapezius (UT, LT), serratus anterior and anterior/middle deltoid. At baseline and after tasks, pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) were recorded bilaterally over the head, UT, and leg.
Results
All tasks caused clinically relevant increased NRS (≥2/10) compared to baseline (P < 0.001). NRS was higher in Task-D (P < 0.003) and lower in Task-B (P < 0.005) than others. PPTs did not change from baseline. Task-D caused higher UT and LT RMS-EMG (P < 0.02) than other tasks.
Conclusion
A 15-min task caused pain irrespective of posture with some causing larger changes than others.}

abstract = {The importance of Safety Management Systems (SMS) to the railway industry is underlined by the fact that all organisations operating on UK railways are required by law to have one. Analysing SMSs can provide a reliable systemic tool to identify hazards and weaknesses within complex systems like the railway, making it possible to significantly increase safety, reducing the odds of near misses and accidents. However, there is little empirical research evidence to determine the impact on safety of a structured SMS. The current paper describes two studies which use Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN) to conceptualise SMSs and their impact on front-line performance. The paper presents the usefulness of BBNs to compare complex systems and reconcile cultural differences within the railway industry, identifying factors that are deemed vital within Italy and Britain. The two studies allowed us to identify the most influential factors within a SMS and how they interact with each other, as well as the strength of the identified relationships. A BBN is particularly useful in estimating how changing some of the node states (e.g., by making safety leadership present) affected the other factors. The current study showed that safety leadership has an impact on the SMSs of the British and Italian railway industries.}

Given train horns' adverse effects on the health and well-being of residents living near rail tracks, the use of train horns must be beneficial to safety. The current study sought to determine in a laboratory environment whether road users (N = 31) can detect the range of train horns observed in Australia in terms of loudness and duration, using high-definition audio recordings from railway crossings. A repeated measures design was used to evaluate the effects of key factors likely to influence the detectability of train horns, including, visual and auditory distractive tasks, hearing loss and environmental noise (crossing bells). Train horn detectability was assessed based on participants' accuracy and reaction times. Results indicated the duration of the train horn had the most influential effect on the detectability of train horns, with short-duration train horns less likely to be detected. The presence of bells at a crossing was the second most important factor that limited train horn detection. Train horn loudness also affected detectability: faint blasts were less likely to be noticed, while loudest blasts were more likely to be noticed. However, loud horns reduced the ability to detect the side from which the train was approaching and may result in longer times to detect the train, in the field. The auditory distractive task reduced the train horn detection accuracy and increased reaction time. However, the visual distractive task and medium to severe hearing loss were not found to affect train horn detection. This laboratory study is the first to provide a broad understanding of the factors that affect the detectability of Australian train horns by road users. The findings from this study provide important insights into ways to reduce the use and modify the practice to mitigate the negative effects of train horns while maintaining the safety of road users.}

Although such systems are currently seeing increasing applications in public realms, limited understanding remains regarding how humans interact with the virtual environments displayed within. Synthesizing virtual reality ergonomics and human-building interaction (HBI) knowledge allows us to investigate these systems meaningfully. In this work, we develop a model of content analysis based on hardware components of the Collaborative-Research Augmented Immersive Virtual Environment Laboratory (CRAIVE-Lab) and the Cognitive Immersive Room (CIR) at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Situating ROIS as a joint cognitive system, this model consists of five categories of qualitative factors: 1) general design approach; 2) topological relationships; 3) features of tasks; 4) hardware-specific design modalities; and 5) interactive qualities. We probe the comprehensiveness of this model using existing design scenarios at the CRAIVE-Lab and the CIR featuring both application-based and experience-based designs. Through these case studies, the robustness of this model in its representation of design intention is observed, with limitations on temporal constraints. In creating this model, we establish foundations for more detailed assessments of the interactive qualities of systems alike.}

Stalls occur when the critical angle of the aircraft is exceeded for a given airspeed. Using airspeed as an indicator of the potential to stall is an unreliable proxy. Systems that measure the angle of attack have been routinely used by military aircraft for over 50 years however rigorous academic research with respect to their effectiveness has been limited. Using a fixed-base flight simulator fitted with a simulated, commercially available angle of attack system, 20 pilots performed normal and emergency procedures during the circuit/pattern in a light aircraft. Experimental results have shown that pilot performance was improved when angle of attack was displayed in the cockpit for normal and emergency procedures during the approach phase of flight in the pattern/circuit. In relation to pilot workload, results indicated that during the approach phase of flight, there was a moderate but tolerable increase in pilot workload. The use of such a display may assist pilots to maintain the aircraft within the optimum range and hence reduce occurrences of unstable approaches. Overall, fewer stall events were observed when angle of attack was displayed and appropriate pilot decisions made during emergencies. These results provide a new perspective on pilot workload and aviation safety.}

To fill this literature gap, a new VR-based safety training was developed and compared with lecture-based training across time. We conducted a quasi-experiment with a non-equivalent group design with 102 workers from six construction sites in Colombia. Learning objectives, observations from training centers, and national regulations were considered during the design of the training methods. Training outcomes were assessed using Kirkpatrick's model. We found that both training approaches were effective in improving knowledge test results and self-reported attitudes in the short-term; and risk-perception, self-reported behavior and safety climate in the long-term. In particular, participants of the VR-based training got significantly higher results in knowledge and reported higher attitudes (commitment and motivation) than participants of the lecture-based training. We suggest that safety managers and practitioners should invest in VR using serious games as an alternative to training programs based on short-term outcomes. Future work is needed to test VR for long-term outcomes.}
