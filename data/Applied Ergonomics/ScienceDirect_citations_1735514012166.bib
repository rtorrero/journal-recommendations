abstract = {Objective
The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of a seat-integrated mobilization system on motion activity, muscle stiffness and discomfort during prolonged driving.
Method
During a 4.5-h driving task, motion activity, muscle stiffness and discomfort (measured subjectively and objectively) of long-haul truck drivers were determined and compared intra-individually in a test condition with mobilization (seat-integrated stimulation) and a control condition under standardized conditions in a simulated driving study (N = 16).
Results
In the experimental condition, participants showed a significantly increased motion activity and a reduced muscle stiffness compared to the control condition. Furthermore, discomfort occurred significantly more frequently in the control condition.
Conclusion
The mobilization system increased motion activity and reduced discomfort as well as muscle stiffness. Therefore, it provides considerable potential to counteract negative effects of prolonged sitting and to promote truck driver's health.}

Whilst some research has been undertaken to improve to relevance of these tests, they are often arbitrary and not based on research. The first phase in developing PETs is to generate a list of job tasks. To examine the utility of universal physical tasks tests for ambulance work, we conducted a cross-sectional study, utilising the results from previous work in a Canadian ambulance service to create a physical tasks checklist. These lists were then used by paramedics working for an Australian Service to identify physical tasks in their workplace, and the results from the two services were compared. Patient transfer tasks were similar in frequency and description for both services. Stretcher handling and manoeuvring was identified by Canadian paramedics as highly strenuous, (mean rating of perceived exertion (RPE) 7/10) but were rated mean RPE <3/10 by AV paramedics. Although some tasks between these two services were similar, the ambulance services in this study differed sufficiently with regard to equipment, training and policies mean that similarly titled jobs are not comparable, cross-nationally. Service specific job task analysis is required to develop PETs that ensure employees are specifically selected to meet the requirements of that service.}

However, compared to 3D anthropometric analysis of adults' heads, this is still an underexplored research area. This study developed a framework for modeling the 3D geometric growth patterns and sex-specific variations of children's heads. To analyze these variations, the entire heads of 793 children (395 females and 398 males) ages 5–17 were scanned, and one global and two sex-specific statistical shape models (SSMs) were constructed. The first principal component in these SSMs, contributing more than 65% to the total explained variations, was highly related to overall head sizes. To model growth patterns, expected average heads for different ages and per-vertex growth rates were computed. Our results showed that the entire female head basically reaches its mature size at age 13–14, whereas in males it continues to increase until age 16–17. This study therefore provides valuable references for children's head/face-related product design, including the development of a more accurate sizing system and improvements in product fit and function.}

abstract = {A prime concern for automated vehicles is motion comfort, as an uncomfortable ride may reduce acceptance of the technology amongst the general population. However, it is not clear how transient motions typical for travelling by car affect the experience of comfort. Here, we determine the relation between properties of vehicle motions (i.e., acceleration and jerk) and discomfort empirically, and we evaluate the ability of normative models to account for the data. 23 participants were placed in a moving-base driving simulator and presented sinusoidial and triangular motion pulses with various peak accelerations (Amax0.4 − 2 ms−2) and jerks (Jmax0.5 − 15 ms−3), designed to recreate typical vehicle accelerations. Participants provided discomfort judgments on absolute ‘Verbal Qualifiers’ and relative ‘Magnitude Estimates’ associated with these motions. The data show that discomfort increases with acceleration amplitude, and that the strength of this effect depends on the direction of motion. We furthermore find that higher jerks (shorter duration pulses) are considered more comfortable, and that triangular pulses are more comfortable than sinusoidal pulses. ME responses decrease (i.e., reduced discomfort) with increasing pulse duration. Evaluations of normative models of vibration and shock (ISO 2631), and perceived motion intensity provide mixed results. The vibration model could not account for the data well. Reasonable agreement between predictions and observations were found for the shock model and perceived intensity model, which emphasize the role of acceleration. We present novel statistical models that describe motion comfort as a function of acceleration, jerk, and direction. The present findings are essential to develop motion planning algorithms aimed at maximizing comfort.}

Despite the expanded use of robotic swarms, little is known about how swarms are perceived by human operators. To characterize human-swarm interactions, we evaluate how operators perceive swarm characteristics, including movement patterns, control schemes, and occlusion. In a series of experiments manipulating movement patterns and control schemes, participants tracked swarms on a computer screen until they were occluded from view, at which point participants were instructed to estimate the spatiotemporal dynamics of the occluded swarm by mouse click. In addition to capturing mouse click responses, eye tracking was used to capture participants eye movements while visually tracking swarms. We observed that manipulating control schemes had minimal impact on the perception of swarms, and that swarms are easier to track when they are visible compared to when they were occluded. Regarding swarm movements, a complex pattern of data emerged. For example, eye tracking indicates that participants more closely track a swarm in an arc pattern compared to sinusoid and linear movement patterns. When evaluating behavioral click-responses, data show that time is underestimated, and that spatial accuracy is reduced in complex patterns. Results suggest that measures of performance may capture different patterns of behavior, underscoring the need for multiple measures to accurately characterize performance. In addition, the lack of generalizable data across different movement patterns highlights the complexity involved in the perception of swarms of objects.}

The primary goal of the research is to investigate how auditory sensations and visual stimuli influence people's behaviour in outdoor built environments. Our technique compares people's perception of the built environment in different conditions: the real world and a replicated virtual world. As a case study, a university campus was used, and four experimental conditions were designed. The study followed a between-subjects design, and the data collection included gaze data acquired from an eye-tracking device as well as self-reports. The study concludes that sound influences human behaviour in such settings. More specifically conclusions are that: i) human behaviour in virtual replications of the real space, including both visual and sound stimuli, is tendentially more similar to human behaviour in the real world than in simulations omitting sound; and ii) there is a difference in human behaviour when people explore the same virtually replicated outdoor space, by varying the presence of sound. This study is particularly useful for researchers working on the comparison between human behaviour in virtual and real environments, related to visual and sound stimuli.}

The results showed that tVNS alleviated SAS and improved driving performance variables more effectively than GCS. We conclude that GCS and tVNS have similar neurological mechanisms to reduce SAS, providing possible explanations for the greater effectiveness of tVNS. We encourage the use of tVNS to decrease SAS.}

Ideally, MS is studied in a safe and controlled environment, such as a driving simulator. However, only few studies address the suitability of driving simulators to assess MS. In this study, we validate a moving base driving simulator for MS research by comparing the symptoms and time course of MS between a real-road driving scenario and a rendition of this scenario in a driving simulator, using a within-subjects design. 25 participants took part as passengers in an experiment with alternating sections (slaloming, stop-and-go) with normal and provocative driving styles. Participants performed Sudoku puzzles (eyes-off-road) during both scenarios and reported MIsery SCale (MISC) scores at 30 s intervals. Motion Sickness Assessment Questionnaire (MSAQ) scores were collected upon completion of either scenario. Overall, the results indicate that MS was more severe in the car than in the simulator. Nevertheless, significant correlations were found between individual MS in the car and simulator for 3 out of 4 MSAQ symptom categories (0.48 < r < 0.73, p < 0.02), with a strong overall correlation (r = 0.57, p = 0.004). MS onset times were similar between the car and the simulator, and sickness fluctuations as a result of driving style showed a similar pattern between scenarios, albeit more pronounced in the car. Based on observed similarities in MS, we conclude these simulator results to have relative validity. We attribute the observed reduction of MS severity in the simulator to the downscaling of the motion by the Motion Cueing Algorithm (MCA). These results suggest that, at least in eyes-off-road conditions, findings on MS from simulator studies may generalize to real vehicles after application of a conversion factor. This conversion factor is likely to depend on simulator and MCA characteristics.}

The dependent measures included participants’ trust ratings after each of seven drives and their takeover performance following the hazard. Results showed that trust improved before any automation failure occurred, demonstrating proper trust calibration toward the errorless system. In the takeover-request and system-malfunction conditions, trust decreased similarly in response to the automation failures, although the takeover-request condition had better takeover performance. For the drives after the automation failure, trust was gradually repaired but did not recover to the original level.

This study aimed to develop and validate the use of a multiparameter wearable armband for continuous non-invasive monitoring of physiological states. Two worker populations were monitored 24 h/day: six loggers for one day and six ICU nurses working 12-hr shifts for one week. Stress responses in nurses were highly correlated with changes in heart rate variability (HRV) and pulse transit time (PTT). A rise in the low-to high-frequency (LF/LH) ratio in HRV was also coincident with stress responses. HRV on workdays decreased compared to non-work days, and PTT also exhibited a persistent decrease reflecting increased blood pressure. Compared to loggers, nurses were involved in high-intensity work activities 45% more often but were less active on non-work days. The wearable technology was well accepted by all worker participants and yielded high signal quality, critical factors for long-term non-invasive occupational health monitoring.}

Participants rated trust and reliance on VA after viewing medication labels and hearing recommendations from male and female agents with varying pitch. Results suggest agents perceived as female were rated as more trustworthy, while vocal pitch did not significantly influence trust. However, a trend of lower reliance with increasing pitch was observed. Additionally, participants relied significantly more on VA advice than medication labels when making decisions. Post-hoc analyses revealed trust and reliance primarily varied between participants. Pitch and gender explained only a small portion of within-participant variance.

Most of the previous research studies have evaluated the efficacy of these devices in laboratories by measuring the reduction in muscle exertion resulting from device use in stereotyped tasks and controlled conditions. However, to date, uncertainties exist about generalizing laboratory results to more realistic conditions of use. The current study aims to investigate the in-field efficacy (through electromyography and perceived exertion), usability, and acceptance of a commercial spring-loaded upper-limb exoskeleton in cleaning job activities. The operators were required to maintain prolonged overhead postures while holding and moving a pole equipped with tools for window and ceiling cleaning. Compared to the normal working condition, the exoskeleton significantly reduced the total shoulder muscle activity (∼17%), the activity of the anterior deltoid (∼26%), medial deltoid (∼28%), and upper trapezius (∼24%). With the exoskeleton, the operators perceived reduced global effort (∼17%) as well as a reduced local effort in the shoulder (∼18%), arm (∼22%), upper back (∼14%), and lower back (∼16%). The beneficial effect of the exoskeleton and its suitability in cleaning settings are corroborated by the acceptance and usability scores assigned by operators, which averaged ∼5.5 out of 7 points. To the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to present an experience of exoskeleton use in cleaning contexts. The outcomes of this research invite further studies to test occupational exoskeletons in various realistic applications to foster scientific-grounded ergonomic evaluations and encourage the informed adoption of the technology.}

Identifying the level of automation (LOA) that prioritizes older adults’ preferences while avoiding passiveness and sedentariness is challenging. The feedback mode should match the cognitive and perceptual capabilities of older adults and the LOA. We characterized three LOAs and paired them with two modes of feedback in a human-robot collaborative task. Twenty-seven older adults participated in evaluating the LOA-feedback variations in a mixed experimental design, utilizing an experimental setup of an assistive robot in a table clearing task. The quality of the interaction was evaluated with objective and subjective measures. The combination of high LOA with voice feedback improved the overall interaction when compared to other LOA and feedback combinations. This study emphasizes the importance of appropriate coupling of LOA and feedback for successful interaction of the older adults with an assistive robot.}

abstract = {This study sets out to extend the use of blink rate and pupil size to the assessment of cognitive load of completing common automotive manufacturing tasks. Nonoptimal cognitive load is detrimental to safety. Existing occupational ergonomics approaches come short of measuring dynamic changes in cognitive load during complex assembling tasks. Cognitive demand was manipulated by having participants complete two versions of the n-back task (easy, hard). Two durations of the physical task were also considered (short, long). Pupil size and blink rate increased under greater cognitive task demand. High cognitive load also resulted in longer task completion times, and higher ratings of mental and temporal demand, and effort. This exploratory study offers relevant insights on the use of ocular metrics for cognitive load assessment in occupational ergonomics. While the existing eye-tracking technology may yet limit their adoption in the field, they offer advantages over the more popular expert-based and self-reported techniques in measuring changes in cognitive load during dynamic tasks.}

Sixty Naval flight students multitasked in an unmanned aerial vehicle control testbed and workload transitioned at three rates: slow, medium, or fast. Response time and accuracy were analyzed via growth curve modeling. Slow transitions had the largest decline in performance over time. Medium transitions had some of the slowest, but most accurate and consistent performance. Fast transitions had some of the fastest, but least accurate performance. However, all performance trends significantly varied, suggesting multiple theoretical explanations may apply and performance may also depend on the individual. Design guidance on how to maximize performance goals with transition rate is provided, but future research needs to study the theoretical explanations and impact of individual differences further.}

Participants drove through a simulated scenario and reacted to HRGCs with and without the IVAA present and through different music conditions and crossing devices. Driver simulator testing results showed that the inclusion of the hybrid IVAA significantly improved driving behavior near HRGCs in terms of gaze behavior, braking reaction, and approach speed to the crossing. The driving simulator study also showed the effects of background music and warning device types on driving performance. The study contributes to the large-scale implementation of IVAAs at HRGCs, as well as the development of guidelines toward a more standardized approach for IVAAs at HRGCs.}

In order to objectively classify female torso shapes, we employed principal component analysis on torso related anthropometric measurements and three-dimensional (3D) torso surface data to identify the most dominant measurements. The principal component analysis of the anthropometric measurements show that Waist Circumference is the most dominant variable to define overall female torso size, and that Chest-Waist Drop and Waist-Buttock Drop jointly define the local shape of the torso. Using these findings, a torso shape classification scheme was developed, where nine shape categories were defined from Chest-Waist Drop and Waist-Buttock Drop while torso sizes were divided by Waist Circumference. The distribution of nine shape categories is dependent on the value of Waist Circumference. Mean shape of each shape category was then generated from 3D scans.}

The task consisted in transferring 24 15 kg boxes from a pallet to another. Foot placement and movements were classified with a recently developed taxonomy. Results show that experts' feet remained static more often than novices' feet during the lifting phase. Positioning the feet towards the deposit site during lifting increased asymmetrical moments, especially for novices. Positioning one foot forward increased asymmetrical moments for novices. Overall, footstep strategies are an effective indicator of low back exposure and should be considered in ergonomic studies.}

The COF was strongly influenced by the contaminant condition (p < 0.001) with hand sanitizer and canola oil having the lowest COF values. COF was also influenced by the flooring product (p < 0.001) although to a lesser extent than the contaminant condition. The contaminants differentially affected the friction performance across the flooring products (interaction effect p < 0.001). These effects were described by the first two principal components.

Although security technologies have improved significantly in recent years, spear phishing continues to be successful due to the bespoke nature of such attacks. Crafting such emails requires attackers to conduct careful research about their victims and collect personal information about them and their acquaintances. Despite the widespread nature of spear-phishing attacks, little is understood about the human factors behind them. This is particularly the case when considering the role of attack personalization on end-user vulnerability. To study spear-phishing attacks in the laboratory, we developed a simulation environment called SpearSim that simulates the tasks involved in the generation and reception of spear-phishing messages. Using SpearSim, we conducted a laboratory experiment with human subjects to study the effect of information availability and information exploitation end-user vulnerability. The results of the experiment show that end-users in the high information-availability condition were 2.97 times more vulnerable to spear-phishing attacks than those in the low information-availability condition. We found that access to more personal information about targets can result in attacks involving contextually meaningful impersonation and narratives. We discuss the implications of this research for the design of anti-phishing training solutions.}

It has largely relied on subjective responses and thus cannot be readily used for adapting robots in shared operations, particularly in shared-space manufacturing applications. Additionally, whether trust in such HRCs differ under altered operator cognitive states or with sex remains unknown. This study examined the impacts of operator cognitive fatigue, robot reliability, and operator sex on trust symptoms in collaborative robots through both objective measures (i.e., performance, heart rate variability) and subjective measures (i.e., surveys). Male and female participants were recruited to perform a metal surface polishing task in partnership with a collaborative robot (UR10), in which they underwent reliability conditions (reliable, unreliable) and cognitive fatigue conditions (fatigued, not fatigued). As compared to the reliable conditions, unreliable robot manipulations resulted in perceived trust, an increase in both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity, and operator-induced reduction in task efficiency and accuracy but not precision. Cognitive fatigue was shown to correlate with higher fatigue scores and reduced task efficiency, more severely impacting females. The results highlight key interplays between operator states of fatigue, sex, and robot reliability on both subjective and objective responses of trust. These findings provide a strong foundation for future investigations on better understanding the relationship between human factors and trust in HRC as well as aid in developing more diagnostic and deployable measures of trust.}

The within-subjects results showed that self-reports of inattentiveness during driving correlated significantly with SART response variability. Multiple regression analysis with brake reaction time as the dependent variable revealed a significant relationship between self-reports of inattentiveness and mind-wandering. However, there were no other consistent linear associations between mind-wandering and SART response variability. Our results not only suggest that inattentiveness to driving caused by mind-wandering impairs braking performance but also emphasize the importance and difficulty of detecting this state from behavioral data alone.}

abstract = {Background
Hospitalists are physicians trained in internal medicine and play a critical role in delivering care in in-patient settings. They work across and interact with a variety of sub-systems of the hospital, collaborate with various specialties, and spend their time exclusively in hospitals. Research shows that hospitalists report burnout rates above the national average for physicians and thus, it is important to understand the key factors contributing to hospitalists' burnout and identify key priorities for improving hospitalists’ workplace.
Methods
Hospitalists at an academic medical center and a community hospital were recruited to complete a survey that included demographics, rating the extent to which socio-technical (S-T) factors contributed to burnout, and 22-item Maslach Burnout Inventory – Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS). Twelve contextual inquiries (CIs) involving shadowing hospitalists for ∼60 h were conducted varied by shift type, length of tenure, age, sex, and location. Using data from the survey and CIs, an affinity diagram was developed and presented during focus groups to 12 hospitalists to validate the model and prioritize improvement efforts.
Results
The overall survey participation rate was 68%. 76% of hospitalists reported elevated levels on at least one sub-component within the MBI. During CIs, key breakdowns were reported in relationships, communication, coordination of care, work processes in electronic healthcare records (EHR), and physical space. Using data from CIs, an affinity diagram was developed. Hospitalists voted the following as key priorities for targeted improvement: improve relationships with other care team members, improve communication systems and prevent interruptions and disruptions, facilitate coordination of care, improve workflows in EHR, and improve physical space.
Conclusions
This mixed-method study utilizes participatory and data-driven approaches to provide evidence-based prioritization of key factors contributing to hospitalists’ burnout. Healthcare systems may utilize this approach to identify workplace factors contributing to provider burnout and consider targeting the factors identified by providers to best optimize scarce resources.}

While much of the research focuses on aspects of the hardware, this article is dedicated to the question of how the configuration of the level of information, i.e. the amount and depth of information in worker guidance systems, is affected. For this purpose, two studies, a laboratory study at the Technical University of Darmstadt (N = 53) and a field study at a company (N = 30), were conducted and two variants of the information level of a worker guidance system were compared. The study results show that assembly quality in particular is significantly influenced by the level of information; to the advantage of detailed information. No significant differences were found for production times. For the subjective evaluation of the system as well as for the objective and subjectively perceived strain, it can be stated that the high level of information also performs better. The results thus help to design worker guidance systems more precisely so that they fulfill the information needs of the employees as well as possible.}

We collected pressure discomfort threshold (PDT) and pressure pain threshold (PPT) from 119 landmarks (unilateral) for 36 Chinese subjects. Moreover, soft tissue thickness data on the head, face and neck regions of 50 Chinese people was obtained through CT scanning while tissue deformation data under the PDT and PPT states was obtained from literature. The results of the three-elements correlation analysis revealed that soft tissue thickness is positively correlated with deformation but not an important factor in pressure sensitivity. Our high-precision pressure sensitivity maps confirm earlier findings of more rough pressure sensitivity studies, while also revealing additional fine scale sensitivity differences. Finally, based on the findings, a high-precision "recommended map” of the optimal stress-bearing area of the head, face and neck was generated.}

We first explored the optimal sensor position by comparing TROMs from four representative locations (T1, T12, L5 and sternum) and optical motion capture system (golden reference). A follow-up experiment was conducted to evaluate the relationship between TROM and fall risk. The results showed that T12 achieved the minimum root mean square error (3.8 ± 2.2°) against the golden reference and the non-faller group had significantly higher TROMs than the faller group. These findings suggest that the newly proposed protocol is convenient yet valid and TROM can be a promising indicator of fall risk in older people.}

abstract = {Visual inspections performed in the final stage of the vehicle manufacturing process are crucial for assuring the quality of painted vehicle bodies. However, lengthy visual inspections can cause fatigue and discomfort of the eyes, which may adversely affect inspection accuracy and efficiency. This study developed a new human-friendly visual inspection method for the detection of defects (e.g., scar and dent) on vehicle bodies, and compared its performance to a conventional inspection method in terms of critical fusion frequency (Hz, indirect measure of eye fatigue), defect detectability (%), and subjective satisfaction score (7-point Likert scale). The new method was devised to project bright-dark linear stripes onto the surface of the vehicle body and created emergent features (distorted stripes) where a defect existed. The critical fusion frequency of the new method decreased slightly (3.7%) after a 30-minute visual inspection task, whereas that of the conventional method dropped substantially (11.0%), which implied more severe eye fatigue. Additionally, the new method had significantly higher defect detectability (92.1%) and satisfaction score (5.8 points) than those (73.4% and 3.5 points) of the conventional method.}

In the second study, the system was explained to 33 participants who were then exposed to three simulations of its main features. Participants were interviewed and the experimenter wrote down their answers, which were analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics 27 software. The conclusions are that special consideration should be given to motorized wheelchair users, and that the designers of the system should include a user interface that explains and demonstrates the system to users.}

During two experiments, participants completed an email sorting task containing both phishing and genuine emails. Participants were allocated to either a high or low time pressure condition. Performance was assessed via detection sensitivity and response bias. Participants were classified with either higher or lower cue utilization and completed a measure of phishing knowledge. When participants were blind to the nature of the study (N = 191), participants with higher cue utilization were better able to discriminate phishing from genuine emails. However, they also recorded a stronger bias towards classifying emails as phishing, compared to participants with lower cue utilization. When notified of phishing base rates prior to the email sorting task (N = 191), participants with higher cue utilization were better able to discriminate phishing from genuine emails without recording an increase in rate of false alarms, compared to participants with lower cue utilization. Sensitivity increased with a reduction in time pressure, while response bias was influenced by the number of phishing-related features in each email. The outcomes support the proposition that cue-based processing of critical features is associated with an increase in the capacity of individuals to discriminate phishing from genuine emails, above and beyond phishing-related knowledge. From an applied perspective, these outcomes suggest that cue-based training may be beneficial for improving detection of phishing emails.}

The proposed approach was tested in a 29-bed intensive care unit (ICU). The centrality of each professional in the advice-seeking social network was considered as the proxy of their contribution to system resilience. A resilience score was calculated for each professional as the product of three network centrality metrics (in-degree, closeness, and betweenness) and two non-network attributes, namely their availability and reliability. Professionals' burnout was the proxy of the human cost of RP, assessed through the Maslach Burnout Inventory, composed of 22 items divided into a triad of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment. Both questionnaires, for social network analysis and burnout, included socio-demographic questions and were answered by 99.0% of the professionals. Results indicated a weak correlation between emotional exhaustion and the resilience score (p = 0.008). This score was also weakly correlated with working overtime (p = 0.005). Overall, findings provided initial evidence that RP as measured in our study matters to burnout, and that the two proxies are exemplars of applying a more general reasoning that might be valid for other proxies.}

abstract = {Background
Despite the potential of occupational passive shoulder exoskeletons (PSEs) to relieve overhead work, limited insights in overhead work precision performance impedes large-scale adoption in industry.
Objective
To investigate the effect of PSE support on the reduction in task performance caused by physical fatigue.
Methods
This experiment consisted of a randomized, counterbalanced cross-over design comparing Exo4Work PSE support and no support, in a physically fatigued state and a control condition. Precision performance was determined using execution speed and drilling errors. Muscle activity and shoulder joint kinematics were recorded.
Results
Fatigue altered task performance, shoulder joint kinematics, muscle activity and subjective experience during overhead work. The PSE support mitigated the fatigue-induced changes in shoulder kinematics. Additionally, a part of the fatigue-induced co-activation of shoulder stabilizing muscles was avoided when working with the PSE. The PSE support also reduced the activity of the anterior and medial deltoid.
Conclusion
Physical fatigue provokes compensatory movements and increased co-contraction of muscles when executing overhead work. These fatigue-induced alterations are generally believed to increase the overall musculoskeletal load. The support provided by the PSE reduced muscle activity of muscles working to elevate the arm, but also partially mitigated those fatigue-induced effects.
Significance
This study shows that the effect of PSE support on precision performance is limited, and suggested that, apart from the known effects of PSE support during overhead work, wearing the exoskeleton in a physically fatigued state may provide additional advantages.}

Therefore, ensuring road visibility in night foggy road is critical. However, it is difficult to reproduce fog on a real road and only a few studies have researched foggy road conditions and visibility in a laboratory as a small scale. Previous studies have suggested that a color temperature of road lighting is related to visibility. However, many have only investigated the effects of relative transmittance in limited indoor experiments, and the impacts of differences in transmittance on visibility have thus far not been studied in real-scale conditions. In this study, a real-scale test involving 91 subjects was conducted to investigate how the visibility distance under night foggy conditions is affected by different lighting color temperatures. Based on the real scale experiments, the correlation between the visibility distance and lighting color temperature was derived. Road lighting with a low color temperature (i.e., yellow) was found to provide longer visibility distances than that with high color temperatures under night foggy conditions having measured visibility of approximately 102m. The impact of the differences in lighting color increased as the visibility distance decreased. In contrast, road lighting with a high color temperature (i.e., white) improved driver visibility in higher-visibility conditions. Therefore, this study confirmed the correlation between lighting color temperature and visibility distance for different visibility conditions and could serve as a foundation for the development of roadway design standards as well as future studies.}

Consistent with the shoes, flooring, and fluid contaminants from the COF tests, participants (n = 66) were unexpectedly exposed to the fluid while walking. Slip predictions were made based on a separate training data set. Slip predictions were made prospectively and using logistic regression analyses. The slip predictions were valid (p < 0.001), 91% sensitive, and 64% specific. The logistic regression fit also revealed that the COF values predicted slip outcomes (p = 0.006).

Between 126 and 146 landmarks were placed on the left side of the head, face and neck of twenty-eight healthy participants (gender balanced). The positions of the landmarks were specified using an EEG 10–20 system-based landmark-grid on the head and a self-developed grid on the face and neck. A 3D scan was made to capture the head geometry and landmark coordinates. In a randomised order, pressure was applied on each landmark with a force gauge until the participant indicated experiencing discomfort. By interpolating all collected pressure discomfort thresholds based on their corresponding 3D coordinates, a dense 3D pressure discomfort threshold map was made. A relatively low-pressure discomfort threshold was found in areas around the nose, neck front, mouth, chin-jaw, cheek and cheekbone, possibly due to the proximate or direct location of nerves, blood veins and soft (muscular) tissue. Medium pressure discomfort was found in the neck back, forehead and temple regions. High pressure discomfort threshold was found in the back of the head and scalp, where skin is relatively thin and closely supported by bone, making these regions interesting for mounting or resting head, face and neck related equipment upon.}

In many scenarios, traffic safety and efficiency can be somewhat contradictory, especially in the perception of a user. In order for potential users to accept the automated system, it is necessary to find the optimal system configuration. Therefore, it is important to understand how the factors underlying acceptance develop and interact. In this study, seven safety distances of an automated parking system were implemented resulting in parking manoeuvres of varying efficiency (in terms of required moves). Participants experienced each configuration twice and rated their perceived safety and perceived usefulness. The results show that maximizing safety distances results in high perceived safety, yet also a diminished perceived usefulness due to reduced efficiency. On the other hand, maximum efficiency leads to a lower perceived safety and thus, a reduced rating of perceived usefulness. Furthermore, in some participants, perceived safety increased gradually, while for others, a threshold effect could be observed. The results demonstrate that the specification of a sole system characteristic can have multiple effects. These have to be considered to maximize acceptance.}

abstract = {The objective of this study was to quantify performance in an obstacle clearance task among individuals with excess body weight or body mass index (BMI). Task performance was operationalized as the maximum obstacle height cleared, four duration measures of successful task completion and compensatory movements used in the process of task completion. Eighteen participants with a BMI exceeding 30 kg/m2 completed a laboratory experiment that required stepping over seven lightweight obstacles. Obstacle heights were sequentially increased from 36 cm in 5 cm increments until participants were unsuccessful or unable to clear the obstacle up to 66 cm. Successful task completions decreased from 100% at an obstacle height of 36 cm to 66.1% at 66 cm. Higher obstacle heights were associated with significantly fewer task completions, longer leading and trailing leg stance and overall task duration, and more frequent use of compensatory movements for successful obstacle clearance. Cox PH regression was used to test the association between probability of obstacle clearance and normalized obstacle height adjusting for BMI, standing balance, and type of compensatory movement used, namely, hover and pivot motions involving the leg, and hands for bracing. The probability of successful task completion significantly decreased with increases in BMI (hazard ratio, HR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.05–1.25), and increased with use of a leg pivot motion (HR = 0.30, 95% CI: 0.09–0.96) during task completion, after adjusting for standing balance and other types of compensatory movements. Overall, the results demonstrated that obstacle clearance performance is affected by an individual's BMI and the use of compensatory behaviors for regaining stability. The ability to recruit internal and external stabilization techniques could potentially serve as a clinical indicator of reduced fall risk and be the focus of fall prevention interventions. Implications for evaluating stability, fall risk, and identifying modifiable factors for fall prevention in the obese population are discussed.}

The extent to which changes in circadian phase relate to reported levels of jet lag remains unclear. The main aim of the present study was first to evaluate the relationship between objective (circadian phase) and subjective jet lag and second to explore the relative role of both subjective and objective psycho-behavioural factors in predicting the subjective experience of jet lag. Twenty-eight long-haul cabin crew completed questionnaires measuring diurnal preference, trip characteristics and subjective jet lag as a single and as a multidimensional measure. Sleep was monitored using actigraphy and urinary melatonin peak time was measured, at baseline (T1), e.g. before a long-haul trip and post-trip on the crew's first recovery day (T2). Subjective jet lag was also measured at both time points. At T1, later circadian phase related to increased unidimensional jet lag, however, a post-trip discrepancy was found between objective and subjective uni- and multidimensional jet lag measured at T2 and change from T1 to T2. After controlling for direction and size of circadian phase, increased uni- and multidimensional subjective jet lag was predicted by depressed mood states. The regression models including phase, diurnal preference, departure time on the outbound sector and arousal levels accounted for 28% of the variance in unidimensional jet lag and 53% of the variance in multidimensional jet lag. It was concluded that there is a discordance between objective and subjective jet lag post-trip. Further, subjective jet lag in long-haul cabin crew is better explained by mood impairment than circadian phase. The results are discussed with reference to the gap between subjective and objective jet lag and the role of psychology rather than just biology in the jet lag experience. The implications for improving health and safety in the workplace, through a better understanding of the role of human factors in the management of jet lag, are discussed.}

Tele-operation is key in the exploration of the Moon, and allows for robotic elements to be controlled from orbital infrastructure and other planetary bodies such as the Earth. Considering that future missions aim to control rovers (amongst others for sampling tasks) from Earth (delay: 3s), the Gateway (delay: 0.5s) and the Moon (delay: 0s), control under the time-delay conditions for these locations must be studied. Time-delay can affect performance, and understanding the performance means that mission operations can be planned bottom-up, which benefits both the preparation of the crew and the design of rovers. An experiment was conducted with 18 engineers who were assigned to control a robotic arm under three time-delay conditions, representing the three control locations. Several metrics were derived from cardiac, ocular, subjective and behavioral measures. The analyses disclosed that the large time-delay condition statistically increased the perceived workload, the time to complete the mission and decreased heart rate variability compared to the other conditions. However, no effect of time-delay was found on attentional and executive abilities. The metrics proved to be effective in the study of performance quantification in human-robot interaction for tele-operations in lunar control scenarios. This approach can be implemented for a larger range of robotic activities, such as tele-operated driving.}

Eighteen participants performed sequential repetitive bouts of lifting divided into a short bout, and three phases of a prolonged bout until volitional fatigue (or until a 1-h time limit). Whole-body kinematics were collected to calculate variability in three-dimensional joint angles and in continuous relative phase (CRP) of sagittal joint angle couplings, which were summed for the upper and lower body, and whole-body. Excellent individual consistency (ICC = 0.95–0.97) was demonstrated across lifting bouts as fatigue developed. Therefore, strong evidence was obtained for MV as an individual trait in support of the repeaters-replacers hypothesis. Associations were found for endurance and baseline effort with lower body variability, while no associations were found for rate of fatigue. Thus, some support was found for the variability-fatigue hypothesis which suggests that repeaters are less fatigue-resistant than replacers.}

Multitasking often results in performance decrements, where adding more tasks can cause a decrease in performance in each of the individual tasks. However, little research investigated multitasking performance in simulated environments. In the current study we examined how multitasking affects performance in simulated environments. Forty-eight participants performed a dual visual search and word memory task where participants were navigated through a simulated environment while being presented with words. Performance was then compared to single-task performance (visual search and word memory alone). Results showed that participants experienced significant dual-task interference when comparing the dual-tasks to the single-tasks and subjective measures confirmed these findings. These results could provide useful insight for the design of technology in operational environments, but also serve as an evaluation of MRT in simulated environments.}

This dual task was used to investigate the effects of workload and resource competition in distinct parts of the dual-task process. The results demonstrated that increasing the tracking speed adversely affected the tracking performance but led to positive arousal to the secondary discrete response task. Visual spatial signals gave the shortest reaction time due to the optimal time-sharing of the visual resources in the focal and ambient channels. Compared with visual spatial signals, spatial signals of auditory and tactile modalities did not lead to an improved performance because of their cross-modality nature. These findings provided practical design guidelines for dual tasks in which the operators need to complete a continuous monitoring task visually and elicit timely and accurate responses to spatial information.}

Experiment 1 used drift diffusion modeling to quantify decision parameters, including rate of information processing, decision threshold, bias, and non-decisional processes. Speeded conditions reduced the information threshold needed to make decisions and shortened non-decisional processes, yet this manipulation had no impact on the rate of information processing or starting bias. Experiment 2 explored perceptual differences in threat assessment. Participants confidently made threat assessments despite only 30 ms exposure to stimuli with little impact on their subjective threat ratings based on exposure duration. Taken together, these results document the influence of speed on decision-making parameters of threat assessments while demonstrating little impact on threat perception.}

To permit the autonomous use of ramps, they must satisfy specific requisites. In particular, the slopes must not be excessively steep but adhere to the values identified in regulations and validated by scientific research. In historic cities, however, the placement of ramps is often complicated by a lack of space required for their length. In Venice, in particular, its urban morphology often makes it impossible to conform to the required slopes. For this reason, a specific ramp, known as “stepped ramp”, has been designed by technicians of the City of Venice with a steeper slope than allowed by regulations. It offers many possibilities but even some key problems. This paper presents a scientific analysis of ten different ramps to evaluate the structures that directly influence the feeling of comfort or discomfort of a wheelchair user with assistance, as well as the coefficients of friction of the different flooring surfaces. This study aims to understand objectively if this solution is efficient to improve accessibility in some specific circumstances, where it is not possible to follow the regulations using flat ramps.}

It is hypothesized that gripping force is related to lifting conditions and may be used as a supplementary risk metric for MSDs in the shoulder and low back regions, because it measures additional hand exertions for coupling the lifted object during lifting. We assessed the capability tactile gloves for measuring the gripping force during lifting as a means for assessing different task conditions (lifting weight, lifting height, lifting direction, body rotation, and handle). Thirty participants wore the tactile gloves and performed simulated lifting tasks. Regression models were used to analyze the effects of the task variables on estimating the measured gripping force. Results demonstrated that 58% and 70% of the lifting weight variance were explained by the measured gripping force without and with considering the individual difference, respectively. In addition to the lifting risk measures commonly used by practitioners, this study suggests a potential for using gripping force as a supplementary or additional risk metric for MSDs.}

Participant-specific thoracolumbar full-body musculoskeletal models estimated vertebral forces from recorded kinematics both with and without consideration of dynamic effects, at an identified frame of peak vertebral loading.

The purpose of this exploratory study was to compare the effects of three novel input modalities, i.e., touchscreen-based interaction (TBI), speech-based interaction (SBI), and gesture-based interaction (GBI), on driving performance and driver visual behaviors. Moreover, we examined if the influence of different modalities would be moderated by the difficulty level of NDRTs. A total of 36 participants were invited to a simulated driving experiment where they were randomly assigned to one of the four groups (TBI, GBI, SBI or baseline) and completed three driving trials. The results showed that TBI led to the worse driving performance, as indicated by the significantly prolonged reaction time, reduced minimum time-to-collision, and increased variations in both longitudinal and lateral vehicle control. The deteriorated driving performance could be attributed, at least partially, to the intense visual demand induced by looking towards the touchscreen, as indicated by more and longer off-the-road glances. The adverse impacts of GBI were relatively smaller, but it still posed great crash risk by leading to a shorter minimum time-to-collision and less stable vehicle control compared to the baseline. SBI, although not completely equivalent to the baseline group, showed the minimum influence on driving and visual performance. Only very few interaction effects were found, suggesting that the effects of modality were quite robust across different NDRTs. It was concluded that SBI and GBI provided safer alternatives to in-vehicle interaction than TBI.}

Ensuring that pool lifeguards develop the skills necessary to detect drowning victims is challenging given that these situations are relatively rare, unpredictable and are difficult to simulate accurately and safely. Virtual reality potentially provides a safe and ecologically valid approach to training since it offers a near-to-real visual experience, together with the opportunity to practice task-related skills and receive feedback. As a prelude to the development of a training intervention, the aim of this research was to establish the construct validity of virtual reality drowning detection tasks.
Method
Using a repeated measures design, a total of 38 qualified lifeguards and 33 non-lifeguards completed 13 min and 23 min simulated drowning detection tasks that were intended to reflect different levels of sustained attention. During the simulated tasks, participants were asked to monitor a virtual pool and identify any drowning targets with accuracy, response latency, and dwell time recorded.
Results
During the simulated scenarios, pool lifeguards detected drowning targets more frequently and spent less time than non-lifeguards fixating on the drowning target prior to the drowning onset. No significant differences in response latency were evident between lifeguards and non-lifeguards nor for first fixations on the drowning target.
Conclusion
The results provide support for the construct validity of virtual reality lifeguarding scenarios, thereby providing the basis for their development and introduction as a potential training approach for developing and maintaining performance in lifeguarding and drowning detection.
Application
This research provides support for the construct validity of virtual reality simulations as a potential training tool, enabling improvements in the fidelity of training solutions to improve pool lifeguard competency in drowning detection.}

We augmented this by identifying additional models and taxonomies from related fields. Together, this “taxonomy of taxonomies,” and the essential XR capabilities identified, serve as an initial framework to structure the development of XR-based medical training and guidance for use during deep space exploration missions. We provide a schematic approach, illustrated with a use case, for how this framework and materials generated through this study might be employed.}

abstract = {As driving performance relies heavily on the interpretation of visual information, driving simulators require a visual display that can effectively communicate the virtual environment to the driver. Most high-fidelity visual displays include an expensive system of high-definition projectors and wraparound screens. To reduce the overall cost of a driving simulator while preserving the generalizability of results to naturalistic driving, head mounted displays (HMD) are being considered as a substitute visual cueing system. Recent innovations to virtual reality technologies are encouraging, however, differences between HMDs and more traditional visual displays have not been explored for all types of driving measures. In particular, while existing literature provides insight into the validity of HMDs as a substitute for higher fidelity visual displays in tests of driver behaviour and performance, there is a gap in the literature regarding differences in physiological responses. In the current study, upper body muscle activation and joint angle ranges were compared between an Oculus™ Rift Development Kit 2 HMD and a system of wrap around screens. Twenty-one participants each completed two simulated drives, one per display, in a counterbalanced order. During the simulation, drivers encountered unanticipated pedestrian crossings during which peak surface electromyography, root-mean-square of the surface electromyography signal and joint angles were determined bilaterally on the upper limbs. No significant differences (p ≤ 0.05) were observed between the Oculus™ Rift HMD and the wrap around screens for all dependent variables with the exception of left joint range of motion in female participants, suggesting that the HMD reduced field of view had a minimal effect on driver kinematics and no effect on muscle activation levels. Upper body bracing was observed during the hazard response time segments characterized by significantly increased muscle activity during hazard response time segments and minimal joint movement. Considering the lack of significant kinematic and muscle activation differences between the two visual inputs, HMD technology for hazard response may provide a suitable alternative to wrap around screens for studying kinematic responses during hazardous driving scenarios.}

abstract = {Understanding the challenges Law Enforcement Officers (LEOs) have encountered with their vehicle and equipment and the correlation between equipment configuration and LEO body dimensions is critical for improving vehicle/equipment specifications to better accommodate today's LEOs. 974 LEOs participated in a study on their vehicle, equipment, and body measurements at 12 sites across the U.S. 88% participants reported discomfort/pain at the end of a shift. The most affected body areas were the lower back and hips. Handguns, radios, and handcuffs on duty belt and seat adjustment were associated with the discomfort/pain. 41% LEOs identified inadequate seat adjustment. Stature, buttock-popliteal length, eye height (sitting), knee height (sitting), shoulder-grip length, popliteal height, sitting height, hip breadth, and body weight were key parameters associated with seat adjustment needs. A third of officers experienced neck pain associated with the use of in-vehicle mobile data terminals and more fore/aft adjustment was needed.}

abstract = {Despite the negative impact of social isolation on wellbeing, research has yet to address how organisations may mitigate the effects of workplace isolation and loneliness. The main objective of the study is to explore the mediating role of task interdependence and supportive behaviours of colleagues on the relationship between workplace isolation on workplace wellbeing. A total of 137 volunteers completed a survey assessing workplace isolation, loneliness, task interdependence, supportive behaviours of colleagues and wellbeing at work. SEM analyses supported the negative effects of company isolation on workplace wellbeing. While supportive behaviours had a mediating role, task interdependence did not mediate the relationships between company isolation and loneliness, and wellbeing. The findings show that increased opportunities for interpersonal interactions at work through greater task interdependence are not enough to reverse the negative effects of workplace isolation on wellbeing. In contrast, an investment in a supportive environment may reverse the negative effects of workplace isolation on wellbeing, highlighting the importance of a supportive culture.}
